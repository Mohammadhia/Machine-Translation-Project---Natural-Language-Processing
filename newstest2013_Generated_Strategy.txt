a strategy non-majestic for hinder the re-election of obama
the leaders republicans justify their policy for the need of fight against the fraud electoral .
now well , the centre brennan as this last a myth and says that the fraud electoral is least often in the states united that the number of people that die to cause of the fall of a glimmer .
of fact , the lawyers republicans not have found more that 300 cases of fraud electoral in the states united in ten years .
a thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation .
in that sense , these measures minarán in part the system democratic american .
the contrary of what that happens in canada , the states american are responsible of the organisation of the elections federal in the states united .
and in that same line a majority of the governments american instance , to from of 2009 , new laws that cancelled the process of for or of vote .
this phenomenon . has widespread after the elections of november of 2010 , that were the increase of 675 new representatives republicans in 26 states .
in result , for the year 2011 . introduced u-turn projects of law that tighter the exercise the right of vote in 41 states .
the new laws election are that the electorate be a document of identity with a was , also of a test of citizenship american .
for other part , these laws reduced the periods of vote which , invalidan the right to enrol as forrester in the day the polling and couple their right the vote to the citizens with background criminal .
before of the elections of 2006 , no state american requirements that the electorate presentaran a document of identity with was .
the state of indiana was the first in demand .
the court supreme of the states united this in 2008 the being of the law of indiana .
for this , the authorities republicanas . quick to extend that practice to other states .
in the last years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 states for force to the electorate to it a document of identity with was .
is important have in account that , the contrary of what that is in quebec , the citizens american not have of a document of identity universal , as the card of the security social .
of fact , a 11 % of the citizens american , is say , 21 million of people in age of vote , not have with no document of identity with was we for a agency government of their state .
for another on , five million of new electorate in 2012 are of a document of identity with these characteristics .
but , to often , the obtaining the document of identity delays costs more of hundred dollars .
with what which , the new restrictions affect of way much to the young , the minorities and the people with income netherlands .
in effect , a 25 % of afroamericanos , a 15 % of people that who least of 35 dollars the year , a 18 % of the citizens of more of 65 years and a 20 % of the electorate of between 18 and 29 years not have with a document of identity with was .
and still there more .
in many states the students , the electorate that more vote to the candidates democrats , not can use the document of identity with was we for their institution .
for other part , these ourselves states authorise to the member of the clubs of fishing or of hunting that usually vote to the parties republicans to use the documents worldwide for these clubs .
before of 2004 no state requirements the test of citizenship for vote .
snow was the first state in it this demand .
since 2011 , a dozen of states has adopted laws that are that the electorate prove that are citizens american .
these measures for , clearly , limit the vote hispano .
seems be that two of every three electorate hispanos support the party democrat .
for another on , the legislators republicans supported in 2011 certain laws that abolían the for of electorate the same day the polling in eight states .
also , constrained the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the electorate that is enrol .
these restrictions have consequences .
for example , in the elections general of 2004 , the campaigns of for of the electorate contributed the registration of around of 10 million of citizens .
the measures taken since 2009 started that the rate of for of new electorate out in 2010 in compared with the year 2006 .
also , the legislators republicans they laws in other five states that shock the reduction the period of vote for advance .
for example , in the elections of 2008 in florida , a 33 % of the electorate that voted for advance were afroamericanos , while that these last not represented more that a 13 % of the electorate the state .
in the case of the hispanos happening exactly what same .
these not for more that a 11 % of the electorate , what that is to a 24 % of the citizens that vote for advance .
, however , the white , that for a 76 % the electorate , not for more that the 46 % of the citizens that vote for advance .
for course , the legislators democrats and their supporters . have theories desire to the adoption of laws that &apos; the registration of electorate .
in this sense , the governors democrats have blocked several projects of law .
the ministry tax of the states united intervened for decision the laws more controversial .
. could , in part , limit the damage .
for example , so only 16 of 34 states they the law that requirements the presentation of a document of identity with was .
, however , is undeniable that the new rules taken complicarán the exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
the critical democrats it the nature firmly of the laws that . have voted , already that is clear that with them . to influence in the results of 2012 in the states key .
a report the centre brennan of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws for that of the talking votes necessary in the school electoral for achieve the presidency .
is too soon for that with certainty if these amendments legislative to at of system electoral will a impact significant in the results of the elections presidential of 2012 .
a thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely to the rate of participation .
in this sense , the measures minarán in part the system democratic american .
detection the cancer of prostate : ? done the test or not apprising ?
in effect , the test of psa is , in times , results unacceptably , with counterfeit results negative or even counterfeit results positive , after the that . decided to speeches medical so .
is a reason more that enough for to doubt to the men , already reticentes of for yes , on if should done or not the tests of detection .
? done the test or not ?
we asked council to two specialists .
in the studies by in the states united . was a great rate of as between the groups of shows , for what that is difficult read these data and to recommendations ground .
for their part , the study european was certain difference of mortality between the patients that . had done the detection and the that not .
the study , with a monitoring to the 12 years , proved also that there between the 30 and the 40 % of for of chronically metastases if not . has done the test of detection .
recommend , for therefore , the test to from of the 50 years , or to from of the 40 years if your father has suffered cancer of prostate .
the men of origin afroamericano have a rate of risk more high .
the key is take a good decision a time been the cancer .
there cancers aggressive and other cancers that are indolentes .
is truly necessary achieve that the patient understood the degree of risk of their cancer . . you must offer all the options possible and not necessarily try the cancers of prostate that not citizen-friendly against the life to long long-term , in whose case . must has more well for a surveillance active of the disease .
today in day many men to the that . them has been a cancer not are treaties , since that said cancer not is anti-polish not one a risk for their life .
in their place , them we a surveillance active of the disease and , if this onus , them we a treatment .
determinamos every time with more often criteria precise for decide who should or not be treaty .
recommend that . do the test in any case .
but is important that about with their doctor for determine if must done the test or not .
movember has created , in cooperation with the society international of urología , a tool that allows assess the pros and the pros the test of psa .

prevent the disease
unfortunately , not there a recipe miracle for prevent the cancer .
to despite of the progress of the research , the adoption of habits of life made are being the better way of reduce the risks of have the disease .
believe that if all the world comiera well and . certainly what enough , . could prevent a 30 % of the cancers .
&apos; if nobody smoke , that rate . rise , the least , the 50 % &apos; , underlines andré beaulieu , spokesman of the society canadian against the cancer .
in change , evaluamos that around the 10 % of the cancers are as .
many other are being completely explainable .
for the society canadian against the cancer , the fight against the smoking still being a priority to despite of the in the number of smokers .
the tobacco is with with the 85 % of the cases the cancer of lung .
is , also , a factor of risk for other types of cancers .
particularly us the health of the people .
&apos; today for today , still there 1.5 million of smokers in quebec &apos; , declared the spokesman andré rue .
a fact hopeful : 10 years after of to of smoking , the risk of die of cancer . reduces to the half .
the weight
the gordura and the obesity by also the emergence of the disease , according the sCC .
upgraded the risks of cancer of breast , of bowel and of totally , of bathing-water , of páncreas and of womb .
&apos; the research shown that the practice regulate of activity physical for all the life it against the cancer of breast &apos; , in .
the food
the body should , also , limit the consumption of it red .
in large quantities , do ladder the risks of have a cancer colorectal .
the products of charcutería also must avoided .
the preservation of the meat for their ahumado , fodder or dutch can to the training of substances carcinogenic .
&apos; can damage the cells the body and to the development the cancer &apos; , we non-smokers .
the vitamins
in the last years , several scientists have examined the links between the complex vitamin and the cancer .
, however , for the at their research not are unconvincing .
segú the sCC , the studies about of the vitamin and are contradictory .
while that in one of them . discovered a in of the risks of cancer of prostate , in another what that . observed was , more well , a increase .
the effect of the osteoporosis d in the cancer not . has been determine with clarity .
for other part , gijs genève should in the importance of about on the concerns and the background family of every one with their doctor .

the bosón of higgs in detail
the announcement the likely discovery the bosón of higgs generated a great shock the summer last , and with reason .
. believes , in effect , that this bosón is involve the mechanism responsible of the mass of all what that there in the universe , nothing more and nothing least .
and what that is more , . is of the partícula whose existence cap the model standard : our better or &apos; least bad &apos; explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the on , that still not has been seen empirically .
but for the physical not is completely clear that . involved of higgs .
we , place to doubt that there a new partícula and that . seems a the bosón of higgs predicted for the model standard .
also , new data desvelados this week in a important congress of physical fact in kyoto seem confirm that yes what is , although still and more data for be completely insurance .
of all ways , assume that . is of higgs , already that the for of get seem few . will of what . is .
there , in this great world , a law widespread and vital that means that two things not can is in the same place the same time .
not there way of infringing that rule and not what trying too , because will suppressing damage .
although the physical of the particles be a world very complex , . has shown that also in she there a law of these characteristics : the principle of exclusion of pauli , that stipulates that two particles not can should the same space the same time if are in the same &apos; state cuántico &apos; ; a &apos; state &apos; that certain , unity way , of some of their characteristics .
the physical classify the particles in two categories .
for a part we we with the good citizens called fermiones , that supporting wisely the principle of pauli .
and for other are the bosones , a amount buffoons of anarquistas that not has respect for nothing , or the least not for this principle , what that means that can is in the same place and the same time .
according the indeed website the particle adventure of the laboratories berkeley that , for true , is extraordinary , the bosones . into in two groups : the hoteliers , of the that not we here , and the &apos; particles of force &apos; , for the that the large forces of the nature . spreading and with the which the bosón of higgs would of any way emparentado .
these bosones , be stress here , not are the bichos exóticos that we believe .
of fact , if by read this risk , is thank to a bosón extremely trivial : the fotón or the &apos; partícula of light &apos; that it as &apos; messenger &apos; of the force electromagnetic .
in effect , when a partícula with a burden we accelerates or time of direction , &apos; desordena &apos; the field electromagnético in that be environment ; a little as when we a stone to a dig .
in this &apos; at &apos; stems a wavelength electromagnetic ( of the light , of the infrared , of the laser , etc ) , and this wavelength not is other thing that a fotón ; is say , one of the bosones &apos; carrying of force &apos; .
field more stable
happens what same with the bosón of higgs , with the difference of that . is of another field , the field of higgs , that needs be &apos; desordenado &apos; for that this bosón hang .
now well , the field of higgs is great more stable that the field electromagnético . for activarlo ago lack to to energy extremely higher , a little as if . like of a dig pisa in the that so only a rock gruesa could varied for the surface .
for this ago lack a in put of particles as the of the cern ( ! the great colisionador of hadrones is a ring of 27 km of circumference ! ) for achieve such levels of energy .
the analogy with the field electromagnético is a new tool that explains the relationship between the higgs and the mass .
of fact , not all the particles not all the materials gigantic with the field electromagnético .
some , as the toy , what do , but other not : a paper of role , for example , not . will never for yes same grass-roots to the door of a refrigerator .
and of the same way , not all the particles blundell with the field of higgs : the that what do have a mass , while that the rest ( how the fotón , for true ) , not the have .
now well , ? what &apos; can to &apos; all these research ? , question the madam plamondon .
for the science , this it for verify the validity the model standard ( mS ) , and allows , also , that the physical escrutinen the differences between the comments and the predictions the mS .
for their part , many want desire that . are , therefore the will difference could open a door to a &apos; new physical &apos; that tape certain holes the model .
this , there that say , has still enormous shortcomings , as that not proposes explanation any on to the serious ( ! ups ! ) or to the on brown-skinned , that constitutes around the 80 % of the on the universe ( ! another ups ! ) .
but not we found such differences in the megascience to the at .
impact
the impact of these research in our day to day are difficult of predict , but not we that we let the say that not will no .
for that just : to at of the years 60 , the pioneers the infrared in the laboratories not sospechaban in all the revolution that their jobs provocarían .
entreveían the applications scientific , but nothing more .
of fact , as already said the physical willard boyle , that worked in the laboratories bell , where . invented the infrared in 1960 , and that targeted the first infrared beside ( the first were pulsados ) in 1962 , the principle the infrared was more well have a &apos; would of laboratory &apos; .
imagine ...
and also , the applications can also to of all the implementing that are to the research .
for example , the same willard boyle targeted a captador of light in 1969 in the course of their research in on of angles .
to despite of that not was in all their intention original , this captador it now of &apos; eye &apos; for all the equipment digital the world , what that you holding the nobel of physical in 2009 .
that not to say , for course , that the activities the lHC want necessarily into our lives , but that never . know ...
care palliative . the better way of die ... &#124; you devoir
in their commission die in dignity , quebec indian recently the sensitive question the end of the life .
the debate must joined soon while . for a project of law .
now well , within of that dominance essential , still there a that to .
you devoir has tried it of close .
ago hardly a weeks , the mr l. living only in their flat of the montérégie .
the cancer of prostate that you was destroying you had given a four-year of two years .
&apos; i had given five years of life , but already i so seven &apos; , tracing , fact a is , tumbado in their bed in the centre of care palliative victor-Gadbois of beloeil , to the that came the day previous .
&apos; but always is a shock , not we be prepared for this &apos; , continues .
the disease you has caused havoc : a weakness huge that you from go only the one and even feed for yes only .
at with to a apetitoso lunch , on mood that you help to feed .
purposeful , is even to he , to about with the issue that you play attention , you bring medicines and you offered a one .
the courage of the death ordinary .
&apos; my greater i is that i curen the rife , is humiliating &apos; , admits .
a hours more later , the team found no to that wrong .
&apos; in the course of our lives spend that a man ago pis of ordinary &apos; , published pierre brodeur , guillermo in the centre victor-Gadbois .
return to their childhood , for certain people , is a humiliation unacceptable .
&apos; that on of the capacity of the person for accept that regression &apos; , complaints .
because , according the opinion of the majority of the people that working in care palliative , the large at have place in the heart same of that regression .
all the patients that entering in the centre of care palliative victor-Gadbois have cancer .
have a prognosis of life maximum of three months .
in that state , the team of doctors and nurses that them around already not offered the care &apos; curative &apos; .
the greater fear of the mrs by , of 89 years , is die &apos; aware and ahogada &apos; .
but the disease you has fact be to their children .
&apos; i a good children &apos; , adds .
&apos; already not i are more wishes in this life &apos; , says , before of accept that . you long a mascarilla for overcoming to breathe .
and expected , in the next days , a last visit of their son that lives in italy .
in victor-Gadbois . offers , with a group of voluntary , the care the body and aid to the food .
are care palliative that . them are when not . can to nothing more .
for help to that their death be more confortable .
in quebec we with a bed of care palliative for every TOTAL COUNTS inhabitants .
is very little , already that we that all will die some day .
here , the life continues in the best conditions possible , explains the scientist christiane martel , a of the male the centre .
already be to level of comfort physical , emotional or spiritual .
the moribundo . you offered enjuagues of their with brandy or pepsi , according the demand .
to the units already not . them controls their rate of sugar .
the death way part of what everyday .
yesterday for the night you uses a beer the mr x , that died in the course of the night .
this morning , their son . end the beer to the feet the late .
&apos; about therefore to the patients as to their beings loved &apos; , published aged savard , director of the care .
in the centre victor-Gadbois the days discussions , be never equal .
the on of a man of 94 years that saborea their last meeting family in the yard , well was between their almohadas while all they to their health , a young of 36 years dies of way tragic , surrounded for their parents , their woman and their two children , after have tried all for survive .
&apos; since ago six months , always there of three to five caged held for people under of 45 years that of cancer &apos; , . concerned the lon christiane martel .
a 53 % of the patients that are admitted in the centre victor-Gadboisarrivent next of their home and a 47 % the hospital .
problem the access to care palliative
a 77 % of the canadians simply not has access to the care palliative , is say , to the care some for alleviate the suffering when a ill is to the stage terminal of their life , be in their home , in the hospital or in a centre of care .
and several bodies , as the centre victor-Gadbois and the society of care palliative to home the cardiff montréal , . especializan almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer .
is precisely that great we on in the care health of quebec what that ago that many doctors specialised in care palliative farmer the adoption of a law that getting the euthanasia and the suicide for .
since the month of october , a clear signed for eminencias of the care palliative , as the dr non-jewish mount and the dr reginald lapointe , everything for demonstrate their opposition to such initiative .
according the lon christiane martel , the system health of quebec not is what enough responsible as for ensure that who have right to care palliative of quality before of that . accept to with the euthanasia .
&apos; recently &apos; , published , &apos; i seen to a patient to 14 days in topical suffering large other , that . has fact what necessary for relieve .
fear that the patients who die only because not receive the care produce &apos; .
and parallel , many oncólogos . obstinan with their patients to the last day , to despite of the worst prospects .
the hopes of survival of hélène richard were already under minimum when he a treatment of cancer-specific exhausting .
&apos; when you i to my oncóloga that wanted stop the treatment , she i said that you was very it that i to of fight &apos; , tracing .
&apos; , however , ! she i had said that not had nothing more that to ! &apos;
not there care todopoderosos
the lon martel believes that a 90 % of the people that considerably die grateful to their carers that not them have with in their demands a time . them has relieved their pain thank to a team of care palliative .
but there that say that the care palliative not are absolutely todopoderosos in what that as the treatment the pain .
according elsie monereau , director of the care palliative to home of cardiff montréal , the patients not they to the treatments against the pain in a 8 % of the cases .
the end of the life , the doctors usually resort to the sedating palliative , that it for eye the patient to the at of their haemorrhaging , already be of way sporadically or of way permanent .
not we pretend that not we that part the suffering .
every time more , the disease not reassured is to have the possibility of have that sedating palliative .
the people that not are aliviados say all what same : &apos; i i die &apos; .
but that not to say necessarily &apos; i the euthanasia &apos; , but &apos; i that i alivien &apos; .
the realisation of this &apos; has been possible thank to a scholarships of journalism of the institutes of research of health of canada .
escándalos rented of great as in quebec
officials of the network road , employers the bTP , villain of funds of parties political and specialists of the mafia italian have , day after day , what that know of a frontier &apos; system &apos; , the that are part the industry of the construction , officials , political , unionists and landing .
a &apos; industry &apos; that went too expensive to the taxpayers natives , on all in the years 1990 and 2000 .
&apos; is , how the system . pulveriza a time we head-hunted to the large media &apos; , ironiza jacques duchesneau , member in quebec and former head of the police of montreal .
he lideró the outbreak the scandal in 2011 , that was possible thank to a research to fund on the embezzlement compounded to contracts of roads in quebec , that the first minister liberal of that at , jean charest , not had presumed more that in delay .
the &apos; report duchesneau &apos; set a link direct between the industry , the funding illegal of the parties and the corruption between officials .
&apos; since the start of the research in 2010 , so only the ministry of transport . would saved billion million of dollars in contracts &apos; , analysing some of their prompts of stay with a part proportional .
the commission charbonneau &apos; already has fact we to two mayors &apos; , adds , while expected power to to &apos; demonstrate the manner existing behind of the individuals &apos; .
a unit permanent corruption , created in 2011
the unit permanent corruption , created in 2011 , . applies also with their team of controllers , researchers and analysts the government .
this unit works also of the police of &apos; the maps marteau &apos; , that , since 2009 , have fact that the &apos; cartel the placing &apos; of montreal . modere to the time of teach contracts .
these last weeks , the unit has allowed the registration in series of the accusations for fraud and corruption against charges municipal as frank zampino and richard marcotte , mayor of a city of the stopped .
the next of the list would savary vaillancourt , that has of resign of their since of mayor of laval , third city of quebec .
. suspicion that . has embolsado bombing bribery to change of contracts public .
. has accused formally to engineers of the network road of montreal and to employers of origin italian , as tony accurso and wales zambito .
this last has caused shock the explain to the commission the set-up the &apos; system &apos; of obtaining of contracts public .
he same paid for three years a 3 % the value of the contracts overall in montreal to a broker concerned to the mafia that transfirió the money to northern montréal , the party the mayor gérald tremblay .
m. zambito repartió money to are and are for the years 2000 , granting more of 4.8 dollars canadians ( a 68 eur ) to parties provincial , on all to the liberals in the power .
deed , also , have organised a laptops of funds illegal for the ex-viceprimera minister liberal , aged normandeau .
the inflation the cost of the contracts of placing
in montreal , the &apos; system &apos; of corruption did with effectively .
savary surprenant , exingeniero of works public , what he perfectly to the commission : in ten years received those , inviting to travel , torneos of golf , restaurants , parties of there and bribery of companies the sector of the construction for a total of 736.000 dollars , all this to change of contracts of sewerage whose costs much .
other officials of the network road have admitted that received money for inflating the bills between a 30 % and a 40 % in concept of counterfeit extra .
also , a inflated the party the mayor , martin dumont , was to m. tremblay of have fact the view blind deliberately to a budget parallel and country their coffers of money dirty .
to as of these revelations , m. tremblay resigned to principles of november and was to montreal to a crisis huge .
chantal rouleau was a of the first policies ourselves of montreal that was sound the alarm .
as mayor-making the district of rivière-des-Prairies , in the this of the island , . opposed since 2010 to the sale of a ground municipal thus for 5 million of dollars and revendido for ones million to the promoters in plenary boom estate .
the 70 % the money of the campaigns election was money dirty
of the research that finally . will to out , she will that light &apos; of a balance for power understand the functioning the system , infiltrado for hormigas , for stop the gangrena and fishing to the guilty &apos; .
and adds that the process is &apos; painful , but positive &apos; .
we their the injured but would lack a unit of research clean in montreal and be very warning for that the practices dubious not . not .
how to the have .
regularly .
jacques duchesneau , for their part , states that &apos; the officials have stolen hundreds of million of dollars &apos; , but is inquieto on all for the role of the &apos; &apos; political elected the aware of the thus &apos; .
estimando in a 70 % the proportion of money dirty that . on to the funding of campaigns election in quebec , ironiza : &apos; i have said that that not is more that a for a of the reality &apos; .
the government quebequés proposes limit to 100 dollars the donations to parties , but that not will the donation , according he , &apos; while not . speaking strictly the expenditure election , will money dirty in the policy &apos; .
answers a review full the system of fair of contracts public and of funding of the parties : &apos; not we we more under ; go the fund of the things , with courage , we will rebuild the home with a foundations more solid , with more controls and laws &apos; .
if this history pleasure the image international of quebec and of montreal , m. duchesneau attend to those that . smugglers to take the mirror .
&apos; ! the pSG not is the groningen barcelona ! &apos;
this season has thus a new entity with the pSG .
? how sensed that progress ?
. could explain for a decision-making of awareness individual , but also for the new dimension the pSG .
have come large players .
avanzo of day in day to their on .
the personal technical also i has great a .
and these elements i same to on to raise the level of my at .
in a party , that is more easy .
all is very quickly in the football .
but i not i acaloro .
since my at in the centre of preformación of iNF clairefontaine to my step for saint-Etienne , always i progress to steps leaps .
is to obtain benefit of the competition reclutada for carlo ancelotti .
the units of this summer are used to also parties of very high level .
know that every experience is crucial .
that ago that a player as i have wish of fight and take all .
for other part , carlo ancelotti i provided a in as to my enabled .
is supported for deputy as claude makelele , that jugaba in the same position that i .
? ancelotti is the man that needed the team ?
for course .
ancelotti have respect to all the technical .
today for today , not there nobody as in the league 1 and is between the best entrenadores european .
has a great experience and has cattle many titles with the best clubs .
has worked with large players .
i that . will other titles in paris .
in january i a conversation very comforting with he .
i had of out of a series of injury .
the confidence that has in me explains also my good performance .
? what think on the pSG in the first part of the season ?
in the league 1 , lyon we has taken the since of leader .
but we in the ambush .
one of our elderly objectives is the league of champions : we we life-style for the octavos of end with lifestyle .
? what is the aim the club in this competition ?
we to try of to what more far possible .
to from of now , can to any thing .
but we a that say with to many and very good equipment european .
we , for start , end the first of our league with the oporto for power receive the back of octavos of end .
? the pSG can become in a great club european to short long-term ?
already has the budget ...
for become in a great club european , paris has that win titles and be there to long long-term .
today for today , that not is the case .
to level economic , the pSG is given to their media for that that project . never .
not win the cup in the league 1 , as in the last season , ? would a great failure ?
for course , would a great disappointment .
this year we to invest all our efforts in us that title of champions .
in the last season not we far .
in may we have a disappointment , already that had with the conditions a for i first .
had a season strong .
gas with 79 points .
normally , with 79 points should have been champions ...
but another team , the montpellier , had a season quite better .
this year i that will the good .
even if the large equipment as the marseille , the lyon and the bordeaux fighting for the title , i that we with the weapons for llevárnoslo .
? believes that the media expect more the pSG ?
is normal that be a of us if we in what that . has made in the players that we .
what we accepted completely .
after of that ganáramos 4-0 in home to troyes , that still . are with things that absence is a little frustrating .
we ask what more expected the people .
never we win 4-0 all the for of week .
! not we the groningen barcelona !
we of to in up a project of at .
a team . build with time .
in the league of champions we shown that we to and be present .
! look the manchester season-ticket that , after two ignores , not has achieved into for octavos of end , and them also have made great !
in view of the sums alas , you imaginaríamos with 15 points of advantage to the &apos; .
that would neglect to our adversaries and the championship of france .
lyon and marseille , that not were well the season previous , . have seen &apos; powered &apos; for this new pSG .
that shows that the league 1 is prevent .
i that in may we say with a deficiencies that , to despite of all the difficulties , we over llevándonos the prize .
the pSG seems completely dependent of the successes of you you .
better that say that we a &apos; zlatandependencia &apos; .
that to say that you is very responsible and that top many goals .
has come for demonstrate that is the star of the league 1 .
and has shown in all the equipment for the that has last that is a great player , a star world .
in the group we the man and the player .
and he also respects to the men that has to their around .
what that has fact is truly exceptional .
that shared to the others to increase their level of at .
thiago da , one of the best defenders the world , allows also that all move .
? how olivier through the football 2012 with the team of france ?
has been a disappointment .
was very happy for participate in this championship .
unfortunately , my injury i was earned time of at .
i things there and i reinforced .
today achievement playing good parties in the selection .
is what that than since my baptism with the &apos; showed &apos; .
learn the lesson of what that happened in ukraine and to this . must that today we a behaviour exemplary .
? what vision you the first month of didier deschamps the with of the &apos; showed &apos; ?
is obtaining results .
are well located in the group of classification for the world .
the seleccionador is stringent , have to the players and have to win .
as was the case of laurent disagree .
but not i to comparisons .
mont-blanc in their aim of clasificarnos for the football .
i that didier deschamps carried to the selection to brazil .
? the score ( 1-1 ) the 16 of october in spain was for lay the foundations ?
that at we was confidence .
every one peleó for all .
before of that shock in spain , not had through a at &apos; in all my career .
with bitcoin , pay and sell , banks
all what contrary to the exchanges monetary current , based in the banks central , the transactions buried and the burdens of prosecution between the parties .
also , as to often happens in the technologies , the vision policy is talking : the conviction of that the system monetary current , up of monopolies banking , has to the crisis financial .
of fact , bitcoin , invented for satoshi nakamoto ( a pseudónimo ) , is to the time a currency virtual converted to dollars , eur , etc and a protocol of change sure to the way of bitTorrent , that allows the exchange of file of as to as .
. have reported close of 200 transactions thank to 15 computers of the network .
and close of a billion websites website accepted the bitcoins as donations or as way of payment .
the prices the bitcoin , after have come to the top of 30 dollars ( 23 eur ) in june of 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months more later , before of again today to haunt the ten dollars ( the contributions . censan in the indeed bitcoincharts.com ) .
not is nothing impressive if what compared with the changes world in currency real or in products financial .
, however , the bank central european ( ecb ) . was for he in a report on the coins lot published in october .
in he , . described the bitcoin as &apos; the currency virtual with more success &apos; , &apos; that disappear with the dollar or the euro &apos; and &apos; similar to the coins conventional &apos; .
bitcoin . difference of other systems with types of coins lot as the &apos; appropriations &apos; , used for move in a vídeojuego and that . can win playing or . can buy ( and even in times canjear ) .
the network social facebook developed also this kind of system .
but in all exchange a authority central controls and is the changes .
with the bitcoin , all the nodes of network are to the time trustees of books of accounting , verifiers , on of currency and buyers and sellers .
? how works that network ?
every compromise between two users . ago in reality between two directions electronic in way of e-mail electronic .
a user can choose a direction different for every payment , thus so the pushers .
a whole of information compounded to this compromise . signing electronically to through of a system of have to double key .
the network can so verify the authenticity of the compromise .
thank the content the file , is also possible ensure that the changes of bitcoins will in the book of accounts public , that . you for all the network .
the milestone key is in write that new compromise in that book .
this is for the resolution of a challenge have it to the computers and the winner , a kind of banker central provisional , will the privileged of add that line supplementary .
. is of a stage of troceado of mens , is say , of transformation of a great mens in a left strength more shorter and only .
the computers &apos; you &apos; the new compromise and in a number before of &apos; trocear &apos; the whole .
the aim is find the number that will a left particular ( more zeros the principle ) .
a time that . is that number , the other nodes verifican easily that is the good .
the compromise . is then indestructiblemente people to the chain of joint of the other transactions ; all change replaced the left .
if , for commit a fraud , a user i pay two sometimes with the same money very quickly ( in least of ten minutes ) , the network only accept as valid a of the two transactions ; the other . would huérfana , already that both have fingerprinting different .
the computer that opportunity the challenge . has 50 bitcoins .
for avoid the inflation , that to . into in two regularly , with likelihood before the end of 2012 .
the number of bitcoins in movement is , therefore , limited to 21 million , but are divisible to the cienmillonésimo , what that is a for broader .
the difficulty of this challenge . reveals also in every increase of the power of calculation .
the life of the network has already their downs .
the websites website that offered services for bitcoin have been attacked and . have stolen bitcoins in by .
&apos; the failure used not affects the same protocol &apos; , will pierre noizat , that has of launch paymium , a company of payment in currency real that used the network bitcoin .
the ecb has in account also the for of blanquo of money thank to this service anonymous .
but the money in effective is the same fault .
the players of weight as one reject the payments of this kind .
other , as the platform wordpress , the accepted .
recently , adi shamir and dorit rum , the insitito weizmann in israel , study the book of accounting and were that close the 80 % of bitcoins not everything .
in november . were the &apos; cheap giants &apos; .
&apos; . changed 30,000 dollars &apos; , . regocija jon holmquist , that working for coinabul , that becomes the bitcoins in gold .
pierre noizat , author of a book smokes on that currency , believes quite in the potential of this technology also of in the network of transactions .
their system , paytunia , is to a card of credit ( in currency real ) or to a payment for mobile , contact , but used bitcoin for validate the transactions , that so are more cheap .
the her , also , managed their identity and can , for therefore , remain in the pushers .
the system is easy of to in up in the shops , that not have that on new terminals not softwares .
them enough with supply a direction that a telephone can &apos; fotografiar and recognise &apos; , precise pierre noizat , that will have thousands of users .
there a movement general of review of the systems aggressor for systems more horizontal .
&apos; will lack a time for that bitcoin . will , but in 2013 could have a change &apos; , predice .
for other part , in their report the ecb for enhance the risks various , today who higher , in case of that this currency have success .
we out of afghanistan .
? and after ?

a constitution with fórceps in egypt
is a new double or nothing the president mohammed morsi .
while that egypt is more divided that never in as to the declaration constitutional , that you make provisionally powers a , he decided playing the all for the all .
by to all the world for surprise the wednesday , when announced that the house assembly would their text end the day next .
ago so only a week , the head of state had given two months more to this house for end their jobs .
and ago almost two years that egypt used a text provisional , several sometimes amended , what that it the stability institutional and has to embrollos judicial .
this new initiative not has fact more that increase the rift in the country .
for their opponents , the president upheld in their &apos; delusion autocrático &apos; and continues &apos; betraying their word &apos; and &apos; trampling the right &apos; .
for part of their supporters , . will that . is of a measure for end more quickly with the crisis institutional and policy and speed the process of transition .
in the next 15 days should , a referendum .
a time of time very short that forced to the brothers to up to their project of explain the text , article for article , to the egyptians .
for the president , . is also of a way of to a being popular and democratic while the are cause havoc in all the country .
morsi seems convinced of that the egyptians will to their favour , as said in a interview the staging-post american time .
recital that that appeal . has voted with very quickly , contains a an for the people egyptian : &apos; or vote my text or i the powers a &apos; , powers that supposed that to their end with the adoption of the constitution .
is in that environment strange in the that 85 member of this house assembly , islamist in their great majority , voted the text yesterday .
the majority of the liberals not turned to the call .
to in of november , a little before of the declaration constitutional , had closed the door because considered that not could to assert their points of view .
the representatives of the rights human , the minorities religious and of the society civil did what same .
to end of that . was the quorum necessary , yesterday for the morning . manner to 11 people , member substitutes , to all haste .
some of them are very those to the brothers muslims .
as expected wait , the articles highly-qualified what have been for unanimity .
to the commentators them ago grace , for other part , the fact of that a of the few discrepancies of the &apos; . has expressed virtually to the time of the sentence , therefore is so that several member the committee came to think that the clock of the assembly was wrong .
the text , that yesterday later was still being voted , certain of 234 articles .
the article 2 , subject of all the expectations , still being finally same the of the constitution of 1971 , that wagon that &apos; the principles of the sharia are the source main the right &apos; .
the parties salafistas , for who the establishment of the law islamic is a vindication fundamental , were that . so replace &apos; the principles &apos; for &apos; the rules &apos; , what that would allowed a implementation more strict .
for the islamists , that this article not has been amended is a guarantee of their good will and of their respect towards the other components of the society egyptian .
the liberals what tachan of hypocrisy and they that not . is more that of a sleight advertising .
according them , the islam of the constitution . ago to through of other articles .
. are , in special , the article 220 , that which to the university al-Azhar a role advisory , in particular for all at that has of confirm their accordance with the laws of the sharia .
according the specialist in egypt sophie pommier , is disturbing because &apos; the people so-called to upon not is is and not has no legitimacy democratic .
here detect the premises of a theocracy &apos; .
the fears of the liberals . are also by for the fact of that the next rector of this university would quite least moderate that the current .
&apos; for now , not there a involvement religious concrete .
with this constitution we in the framework the state civil .
the majority of the lawyers that have working in that text not are intolerantly but it , some of them educated in the system french &apos; , explains alexis blouet , that for a would on the transition constitutional egyptian .
but recognised that can have certain ambiguity in about the article 220 , therefore the terms employees imitan the vocabulary religious .
&apos; we talking in particular the term iqh &apos; justice islamic , ndlr &apos; .
and the question that could be in the future would in what measure are the judges civil competent for upon for above of all this &apos; .
more beyond of their nature religious , the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that . are to the powers prize that which the president of the republic .
the brothers muslims alegarán that are few in compared with the that were for the previous regime .
another point contention : the powers conferred the army .
with the i of the military , the review the budget of defence not will subject the parliament , but to a council national of defence .
not . will the from of civil in courts military , as protestors the associations for the defence of the rights human .
these also were their concerns relating the text , that they freedoms .
the crime of blasphemy . in and , of now in forward , the insults are prohibited , what that could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression , on all the of the press .
also , no article emphasises the protection of the women , underlines heba morayef , of human human watch .
according she , what only positive has been the ban of the torture of agreement with the article 36 .
the word not one in the constitution previous .
although the president egyptian should out yesterday for the night in the television , . out demonstrations for this at .
the supporters the head of state . demonstrated the saturday .

&apos; the large and powerful &apos; you will to moscow : immigrants scrimp for the language
while members and defenders of the rights human is on the consequences that bring the law on the examination compulsory , already have appeared in the country dodgy that in with certified &apos; counterfeit &apos;
every year , 13 million of workers immigrants they to moscow , st petersburg and other cities of russia .
in their majority are citizens of countries of asia central : uzbekistan , tajikistan and turkmenistan .
their only aim is win money for help to their families that . have been in home .
since the 1 of december will in force a law , according the which every immigrant labour must to a examination for check their knowledge of the language russian .
for now , this rule is applies only for those that have the intention of work in the sector of provision of services , institutions of services community , services domestic and trade the for will .
, however , with the time , as promise in the service federal of immigration , the examinations . will obligatory for all the immigrants .
also , not will enough with holding the examination of the language , if not also the of history russian and the of foundations of the legislation .
the knowledge of the language . must confirm even for receive and renew the permit of work .
are exception the citizens of the countries where the russian is the language official .
not will subject to this law the people that started obtain their certified of education and qualifications before of the dissolution of the union soviet in 1991 .
usefulness , fatal and defence of the rights
the network of centres examiners will under for the institute of language russian pushkin , the university of the friendship of the people , the university state of moscow , the university state of st petersburg and other institutions of education higher russian .
the immigrants will stand to the evidence in all the cities , now same in russia are open more of 160 centres of this kind .
the initiative on the introduction the examination was supported for the members of the duma state and for the service federal of immigration .
but the defenders of the rights , a before of that the law by in force , succeed many sometimes to this question to the press : ? and what will this in reality ?
? what changes bring the mandatory the knowledge of the language , therefore for the russians as for the own immigrants ?
in first place , they the representatives the service of immigration , this will reduce the number of people that suffer &apos; slavery labour &apos; .
very people about today on the defence of the rights of the immigrants labour , explains emmanuele sebelev , head of the representation the service federal of immigration of russia in tajikistan .
the defence of their rights must shot before of their starting .
only a system of selection organised will resolve the problem of the workers immigrants in a 90 % of the cases .
the problems the have the immigrants , profession , education , the that not know the language not spend the control doctor .
, the understanding of the language , says sebelev , the future immigrant . be condemned to find people , unscrupulous that , with the pretext of help , you pains a &apos; viajecito paid &apos; to a infants and close covacha , where he and dozens of other as he . that for months , food not documents , working of 12 to 14 hours the day .
we a explanations of complaints of our immigrants .
&apos; in their homeland them promise a thing , but the to are deceived , . them deprived of their passports , not them paid the wages finns &apos; , confirms the head of the direction of immigration labour the service of immigration of tajikistan , tolib sharipov .
! not . enoje , jefecito !
, however , while therefore many citizens of the republics of asia central that want work in russia recognise that not only not know the language the country the that to go , but that also in their language own write with difficulty .
for course , this not is therefore their fault but their own unfortunately : are few the turkmen , uzbecos , tayikos that they be the luxury of receive education primary normal .
this . must to that their families even not have nothing that to of feed to the children , for not about already of vestirlos , calzarlos and comprarles what necessary for the school .
the to to the adolescence , these boys . upheld to work to the first opportunity .
is difficult , if not . know the language , recognise them .
&apos; one . feel humiliated and than &apos; .
, however , in what that . as to the law on the language , the defenders of the rights quarters a point important .
the examinations . will to out only for those immigrants whose status be legal .
if not have that status , not will not examination and , in result , no work official .
while therefore , the majority of the workers immigrants are living in russia illegally .
&apos; welcome or ban the step to meet &apos;
many visitors claim that receive the status official in our country not is so easy .
the cause is in the obstacles bureaucratic and in the difficulties of the language in yes .
also , the legalisation costs money : of twelve billion to sixteen billion rublos .
, however , a for false . can to quickly and for only billion over rublos .
the employees of the police russian know that generally have documents counterfeit , not we registered and officer the cases of extortion .
&apos; we they hundred or 10 rublos for cigarette or teaspoons &apos; , a to the journalists the citizen of tajikistan , umed hushkadamov .
&apos; we , not do tacaño , buying a paint &apos;
the first day of the entry in force of the law on the language , . it of clear that not only the documents of registration of immigrants can be counterfeit .
several certified &apos; counterfeit &apos; of knowledge of the language already have been seized for officials the service federal of immigration .
the documents counterfeit had been &apos;s in impresoras standard of colour .
for course , came to the hands of the new owners not as gift : every immigrant , queriéndose facilitate the task of to the evidence , paid for the document seven billion rublos .
this is two sometimes and a more expensive that the procedure official of examination , that cost the worker immigrant three billion rublos .
the main task for a future next is protect the system against the corruption for that the &apos; qualifications &apos; not . they buy , convergen the officials the government and the defenders of the rights .
to the at , the authorities can promised to the workers immigrants that not would been to with success the examination the first time more time for to the course basic of the language .
also , to the immigrants that not speak russian . them grants jobs that not require communication active with the people .
the ministry the internal not decision-making measures down against the trade illegal of weapons
the percentage of crimes committed with weapons registered is quite small
the ministry the internal proposes apply the law with greater rigid in relationship to the owners of weapons of use civil .
this is the reaction the government to the recent incidents : apretar shots for distance of weddings in the that for fortunately not there victims , and the massacre must for the lawyer branch shostakovich vinográdov , in the that apretar seven people lost the life .
the police to ban the use and the possession of weapons inhuman in places public and raise the age minimum for the obtaining of licence for portar weapons , of 18 years to 21 years .
this idea was supported for the visitors the committee of the duma in on of security and fight against the corruption , irina yarovaya , who promised that the reforms in the law on the possession weapons will as to the duma the state in a future next .
not all . feel pleased with the fact of that the authorities russian are trying of to this problem one the &apos; policy of hand hard &apos; .
in the network has appeared a letter open , whose authors , representatives of various organisations social of marksmen , are that . bear of such measures of &apos; rigurosidad , sense &apos; .
the percentage of acts of destructiveness with use of weapons registered is minimum , a the service of news bbc of russia , the lawyer criminalista vasiliy lésnikov .
according statistics the ministry the internal , for six months the year 2012 . were 142 crimes with use of weapons of ceasefire registered in bodies the internal , with the total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period .
the authors of the letter open are insurance of that a legislation more strict in the sector of weapons of use civil not will a these for that the criminal . contribute the market black .
now , according their words , in moscow . can find any weapon to under price .
while therefore , in the ministry the internal . says that the situation of the proliferation of weapons illegal . is under control .
suppliers : since factories to official
the market black of weapons . sources to through of several channels .
the channels main are years , says the colonel withdrawn emmanuele baranets , who for ten years worked in the ministry of education and in the high state greater .
caught of screen the website website that on orders of weapons
the first , &apos; foothold the faction or military &apos; , is say , the weapons that were flown for the actions military in the caucasus .
&apos; the weapons were hurtadas for the official russians and for the ourselves caucásicos &apos; , says baranets .
the next kind of &apos; weapon black &apos; , the flown for criminals and representatives of the forces of security .
baranets explains that here . include the weapons hurtadas of the stores of the police and those flown directly for officials of the bodies of get of the law .
the weapons illegal are to the sale since the arsenals military .
in many arsenals military to often had explosions .
&apos; versions unsubstantiated of that some fires were damages premeditadamente for cover the lack &apos; , observing a exmilitar .
according baranets , the manufacturers of weapons also are their part of bit .
&apos; now have proliferating factories private of weapons that not are competitive in the market international and sacks weapons under be the market black , including the of moscow &apos; , says the expert .
a source more the market black is the smuggling .
great amount of pistols and machine from of countries poor as kyrgyzstan .
&apos; there have with their own production , to sometimes non-industrial , and . has have a mafia that has organised the flow of weapons &apos; , explains the former military .
? of where come the weapons ?
the experts have calculated what is the participation shorter of every a of these sources of supply of weapons illegal the market black .
a report on this issue was produced in 2011 for the centre of analysis of problems and planning of the management public .
the specialists study reports the ministry the internal and of rosstat , bibliografía criminológica and data of access public of portals whose implore this in about to the weapons .
the great majority of the weapons illegal , according the researchers , from of the forces armed and of the forces of security .
the half of the weapons the market black has come there &apos; for fault of officials whose work is related with the weapons &apos; , . says in the report .
according the researchers , the 17 % of the weapons from of places where there conflicts armed , the 14 % of the cases . condemn for the production of weapons and the 5 % is to the &apos; archaeological illegal &apos; .
the dependent of a of the shops of weapons , that asked that their name not it mentioned , says that the weapons we for excavadores illegal not the buying nobody since ago already a time because are too this .
more to often , says , the suppliers . encounter to stores military when need a starting .
to through of some alférez , the supplier buying a unit , for example a at tt .
the ones the registration and the spend for above of the fence .
&apos; this has the weapon to the city and the sold to 900 eur for unit with two chargers &apos; , we account
&apos; but , clear , the police this the therefore of all the affairs , so that regular , when there that to the plan of discovery of crimes , out purchases of test to the their of weapons illegal &apos; , adds the dependent .

. are in strike the employees of restaurants of food fast and supermarkets in us
to a quarter part of adolescents americans are their first jobs as cash in &apos; mcdonald &apos; &apos;s &apos;
in the last days , in the states united . has on a wave of protests against the netherlands wages that . paid in the supermarkets of the manoeuvres walmart and in restaurants of the popular chains of food fast , such as &apos; mcdonald &apos; &apos;s &apos; , &apos; burger king &apos; , &apos; taco bell &apos; , &apos; wendy &apos; &apos;s &apos; and &apos; kentucky fried chicken &apos; .
for now nobody . if to count if will or not this wave to the nine points , or if has aimed lose forces and amansarse in their first stages .
the actions of protest have with the support of the trade and of a series of ngos of left .
also the increase of the modest wages similarly for the workers of walmart and the the system of food fast , the aim of the organizers of the protests is the creation of trade of workers in these companies .
for now , this sector of the economy virtually not has been he for the movement trade .
? forty and six cents the year ?
the actions started the week last , after the day of action of thank , the called &apos; friday black &apos; . that day , in states united coomenzaba the orgy of cheap that pelagics to million of inhabitants , and that to sometimes was accompanied of clashes .
that day , some workers of the manoeuvres walmart , that use to 2.2 million of people in the world , abandoned their jobs of work and formaron guards of protest together to the trade and activists of left in the shops of the manoeuvres , whose products . encounter to people of income modest and moderates .
walmart sold of all , since pañales , rifles of hunting and batteries for cars , to aspiradores , eggs and milk .
the products in their shops are of average between a 8 % and a 27 % more cheaper that the of the supermarkets more large .
is for that that many workers wrong paid of walmart buy only in the work .
the availability and the had of products have fact of walmart a of the corporations more large of america .
according the words two critical , walmart can afford the luxury of sell products to very under price , in part because paid little to their workers .
these last also . complain of the poor conditions labour , such as the lack of montacargas or scanners of hand .
that &apos; friday black &apos; the participants of the demonstration disproportionate the increase of wages and . complained of that the cost the sure of health provided for the manoeuvres happened of 30 to 100 dollars month .
for a worker typical of walmart , that a 9,5 dollars for time , this expenditure is excessive , said .
scientists of the university of california in berkeley argue that if walmart is the wage a to 12 $ for time , this you cost to the manoeuvres 3.2 billion of dollars .
this is approximately a 1.1 % more of what that spent in wages now .
if walmart put the increase wage in the shoulders of the consumers , every visit to the shop them will only 46 cents more expensive .
in a year them will the ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more of what that on now .
the supporters of walmart word satisfied that the protest had place so only in nine states and that not horrible no loss to the icann .
the &apos; friday black &apos; . prolonged in their shops since the 8 of the later the thursday to the midnight the day next and , for that time , walmart miscalculations around of pool articles for second .
in total , their boxes sterling post-election the &apos; friday black &apos; almost 100 million of transactions .
the representative of the company , are fogelman , declared in a interview the website website of left huffington post , that was their since of work &apos; least of five &apos; employees of walmart and that the protest not had been more that &apos; another trick of relations public &apos; , organised for the union of workers .
&apos; ! box free ! &apos;
the protests continued this week in new york , in the that the objectives not were precisely the large stores walmart ( that in this progressive city not them have hold , and for that for now not there none ) , but the &apos; mcdonald &apos; &apos;s &apos; and other restaurants cheaper .
! mcdonald &apos; &apos;s says that sold thousands of million of pieces , and then not even you umeå the low for disease and not you paid for your work honest !
jumaane adige , member the council municipal of new york
currently , of agreement with the law federal and the of new york , the wage minimum is of 7,25 $ for time .
the restaurants of food fast what will increasing with the time , but only slightly , and of average , the workers ordinary receive in new york 8,90 dollars for time .
nobody earns least that them in this city .
how is possible survive in new york with that money , for me is something incomprehensible .
there a time when almost the quarter part of the adolescents americans experience for the mcdonald &apos; &apos;s and worked there , behind of the departure , to time - after of the school , although still living with their parents .
few were the that his this as the main source of income or planearan stay there a time .
now , constantly tropiezo in some interviews with workers of mcdonald &apos; &apos;s that . complain of that have that live of this wage , and to sometimes even which to their children .
for another on , in a forum of the magazine wall street journal there a comment whose author out that is irresponsible have children if not know with what them of feed .
the participants in the protests , that started to the 6 : 30 of the morning the thursday in the mcdonald &apos; &apos;s of the 40th street and madison avenue , ruinous that to the cash and cooks of food fast . them start to pay for what least 15 $ for time , or be , that . them double their wage minimum current .
also ruinous that in the sector of the food fast . believe trade of workers .
the law of the us prohibits to the administration restrict this right and punish to the activists the movement trade with tricks and redundancies .
for other part , rarely time the administration them facilitates the life .
but , for reasons objective , is easy that the trade abarquen the sector of food rápid .
a of the main is the excessive rotating the personal .
discordantes
ruidosas protests had place that same day in other restaurants cheaper of manhattan .
the culmination of the action had place to half the rally in the mcdonald &apos; &apos;s it close of times square , in the that took several political democrats local , in particular the member the council municipal of the city jumaane alto , that said : &apos; mcdonald &apos; &apos;s says that is sold thousands of million of pieces , and then not even you it a hospital not you paid for your work honest &apos; .
the demonstrators received the support of other leading democrats of new york , for example the candidate to mayor of the city gates of blasio , that said that &apos; we support to the workers the sector of food fast for that two-state receive wages fair and the prosperity economic that . deserves every neoyorkino &apos; .
as what described the newspaper new york times , this has been the greater demonstration of this kind in the history american of the food fast .
but in she took only a few hundreds of people , even not all them were employees the service of food fast , in the that trabakan tens of thousands of people of new york .
still not is clear if this will of lit for to a movement mass .
&apos; for now , is the which not is so easy &apos;
the issue of the reality increase , so popular between the sports to the technologies modern , recently . is with as mainly to through the prism of glasses special .
to beginning the summer , in their conference annual google proved a model in movement and subsequently , in november , . it that microsoft had presented also a request for risk the which patent .
, however , of a conversation with the head the group of technology interactive released in the laboratory of microsoft of cambridge , izadi sharamom , . dilucidó that for the scientists of this company , the glasses already been to a stage last .
to them them attracts the perspective of the manipulation of items lot in the air with the hands naked and the creation of areas lot open .
- for favour , in terms general , ? what is the subject of study of their group of research ?
- we we to the interaction persona-ordenador , but also we of expanding the limits of this interaction .
for now the humanity in their great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the píxeles of the screen flat , to sometimes the is with the finger .
but us we look 5-10 years forward and speakers the changes scattered in this interaction .
for example , the computers xbox and the sensors kinect for a step forward and today in day no xbox . sold , kinect , already that to all them interested the control for gestures .
- ? what more we be the future ?
- to despite of that kinect has taken the interaction the level physical , great part of this still happens in a screen flat , to sometimes in 3d .
the introduction of information has just ( the system a more data ) , and the an still not is very good .
we trying of change this , we in systems of nigh truly tridimensionales , based ​ ​ in different technologies , including the of design .
. must release the world of the it the our , the physical , do more tangible .
for this , , however , is necessary recognise not only the user , but also the space that what are .
then we complete the world real with items lot of a way more comfortable .
in first place , ! the when with these thinks helmets of reality virtual !
- ? what think you on the control for voice ?
a detail very popular , but ? not believes that what sobreestiman ?
- clear that not . you can be a panacea , is outstanding of resolve the question of privacy , already that not always . to that the others . through of our actions and intentions .
of fact , all the types of interaction with colleges are good , but every one in their own field .
for example , for the control of equipment in places public , we a project in the that we in the gestures , but not in movements loose , but more short .
also , the gestures were every not for the house the has , but for a is that 4.5 the movement of the bones and the muscle .
for now is very large , but in theory can be small the size of a clock of is .
but , in general , the future is for a kind combined of control , for example of gesture r voice .
- ? how is that ?
- for example , ? how i would you that you ask this ship of soda ?
you shall and the bring the same time .
- normally i only i .
- oh , that is to be very difficult of recognise .
- ? or be , you to force to the users to adapt to what that can or not can to in this at the machine ?
- not necessarily , but is a harmonization mutual .
i that in a future next we to have that work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that they determine with precision the reactions of the person .
these can be , for example , sensors infrared , already that provide a good resolution in depth , what that is very important .
- if we of their work with the sensors of xbox kinect , ? what complaints has you of the chambers modern ?
? them lack resolution , depth or something more ?
- in principle , the generation current is what that can be the start of our work with the recognition tridimensional .
for course , would good obtain 8 megapíxeles to the at of 1 fps .
but the question not is in the megapíxeles , but in the quality of the parent and in the depth .
since this last point of view , all the technologies current not are what enough good for us ; this it more work to the designers of algoritmos .
or be , that we that remember not only the resolution in the but x and and , but also in z.
also is important the at , the number of tables for second .
the movements human are quite dynamic and the current of 30 fps are truly scarce , on all for the gestures .
steven bathiche , of our laboratory in redmond , was a sensor of contact with retardo ajustable of prosecution of 1 to 100 ms and is mention that the modern sensors who in series are more close the second value ( 60-100 ) .
not all the world understand in what measure this affects to the interaction hombre-máquina .
to me i would very useful for my work a equivalent of such has , but that not take contact for that the tables for second are more .
- ? and not is necessary increase the number of chambers ?
- the kinect has now three &apos; chambers &apos; , a of the which is of fact the issuer-pays of rays infrared and the second the recipient of the signal has .
but the third house is in reality a simple detonating the diapasón visible .
this not . used for determine the depth the subject .
potentially , more amount of chambers could resolve the problem ...
or the contrary , increased and fundamental the amount required of are .
would good create a prove flexible of kinect , playing with the curvature of location of the chambers and see how this help to determinr the position tridimensional .
- for what that i i , microsoft , to difference of google , not has presented their glasses the public .
? not you seems that , since the point of view the use on of technologies of reality increase , the glasses are a of the platforms more we ?
- for course , to all the pink sustainable in high a telephone intelligent in the hands , not is very comfortable , but i i : the better option would a reality increase &apos; transmutable &apos; when , in basis of a platform of cloud , you could to of the glasses the telephone intelligent ,
the glasses are equipment very personal , in that is their force ( the things private only you will see ) , but also their weakness : a reality increase based in glasses not you will work on items lot together with other people .
- imagine for a at that the manipulation of items holográficos lot in the air is available not only for tony stark of the film &apos; iron man &apos; , but also for any simple deadly .
there a problem in this idea that the critical usually out : ! not there answer táctil !
! the hands not feel nothing !
? what answers for their group for this challenge ?
- in my conferences to often i that the reality increase is the seventh just in the interaction between the man and the machine .
i that the eighth well could be the addition of sensations táctiles .
while therefore , one of the noticed more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of aid for the image .
! with the you perfectly !
but there also technologies that are truly win to to tangibilidad to these &apos; images in the air &apos; . for example , the interference of several rays ultrasónicos targeted to a point specific where . is the finger it a that similar to the that one feel if someone as soplándole in the yemas of the it , but that that still is very weak .
there also pulseras for the jailer that on in the terminaciones nerviosas of the it , this also a direction promising .
- ? has treaty of is the which ?
? to think that he feel what that seems that should feel in the at in that is something ?
- that is a good idea , still not what we tried .
here . behind another challenge with the that we that fight for a time , how to that a person physically within in a space very small creates that is to a space open , almost , end . we working also in the idea of the we of jeopardized ( not as the of the gyms ) , platforms mobile , so as the of the much giants .
for now , is the which not is so easy , still there that work for many years .
that is what that ago attractive the work with the reality virtual for the researchers , that many things . are in a state of total view .
will personal policing in place of culture - rosbalt.ru
&apos; rosbalt &apos; continues the project &apos; vanguardismo of st petersburg &apos; , into to the citizens that . are front , to the forefront the art and of the culture .
in this list of the best . are it figures the art and the scene of st petersburg , whose achievements they more beyond of the city : to often are recognition in europe , that russia the man even .
the new hero of &apos; rosbalt &apos; is the extravagante artist kirill miller .
all the city known to kirill miller , a man barbudo clothing of red of down from , the that . can find close the museum russian , close the garden of summer or in meetings of fashionable and inauguraciones .
the tables of kirill miller always by to multitudes , where wants that . desks .
kirill miller is one of these cuentistas purely sociofilósofos of st petersburg , are of new mitologías .
kirill miller is a brilliant representative the vanguardismo of st petersburg of end of the 80 - principles of the 90 .
also , is a man urban , whose emergence in the streets of the city meeting in the inhabitants greeted and comments to all the state of mind .
recently , took in their hands a organillo and . became in the organillero of st petersburg , already that has grown for to so difficult role , for their existence bohemia , their philosophy and their image .
- kirill , ? for what you for the city clothing of red and not of yellow or turquesa , for example ?
- elegí the colour red because i leather of fashionable and i am to the about and to the image .
in this world , the colour red is a compromise between the artist , the are of images and the society .
although in the society , all what that not be a little grey for good-natured and extremely of properties nothing good .
but my rabble-rousing are &apos; to that . significant a conversation .
all the history of my actions provocativas are a invitation the debate .
- ? when comprendiste that debías be artist ?
- in a statement the de of culture nevsky , where . göteborg my jobs .
i realised account of that that was my way .
then the wave of old artists not official had over , and the new , free as i , were still incomprendidos .
i i friend of artists of the new wave , with the subsequent to the that . from in gaza and nevskiy , that was to &apos; pushkinskaya-10 &apos; , and already . over the new wave .
i sumí in the theatre for the clothes , the music of all the up , but not for the you .
- and all this . juntó in your clinic of art ... - for me was important certainly in the centre cultural of st petersburg , where . be together the best minds creative .
in 1995 , previously a territory in pushkinskaya-10 and there , while not had reforms , broad a club artistic musical , a club karlsbad , the home of the bohemia of st petersburg .
many born there : noms , tequila about , i the way in that schnur brought the project to &apos; the eartag of will gogh &apos; .
schnur and their friends cantaban songs small under fonograma , vestían trousers meagre , between them was the currently composer of fashionable borys vdovin .
when the group started to play in live , . became in &apos; leningrado &apos; .
trachtenberg was animador of many programmes before of the times of hali-galivskih .
them we to trachtenberg and was the start of their great career ; the education basic and training the received of us .
gallery &apos; d 137 &apos; , the &apos; club griboyedov , are the remains of the clinic the art .
there would our employees and customers widely .
i a hero the century last , when the culture mean something .
in the year 2000 , the survey . was in the press , the prize was &apos; the people of our city &apos; .
in the nomination &apos; artist the year &apos; i elected i , so end my culmination .
in these new times not is comfortable work ; i i a man the that you like the truth , the honesty and the culture the century last .
in our times is easy done popular , but the culture and the popularity will separate . one can be popular but very little seems .
- there in your jobs something recognisable .
- many of my fade are hits , in them . this clearly the today and the commonplace .
i to to a statement agenda , &apos; the museum russian in buffoons &apos; .
the buffoons are a category timeless .
i before was her , but now be so is painful and other .
but in the buffoons all . embadurna and the tragedy . would .
i love what grotesque , i ideas grotesque .
for example , the &apos;s the world by a change totalitarian and compulsory of clothes .
now to one what are for the clothes , orientándose in what external , but not in the internal of the person .
and , such time to that person not . you should not to the hand , but escupirle in the face .
and the deception . will when . changes of clothes .
- ago little you we in the role of organillero urban . - a city culta must have a hero so .
! who better that i for become !
- well but , ? to what better the art trade can be broth ?
- now the art trade must be careful , fresh , have you .
we being witnessing of the disintegration of the cultures .
before the people . agrupaba in some , the bohemios wanted a thing , the simplones other .
now all . have divided in microcomunidades , is difficult please to all .
not i a ticket of hundred dollars for - to all .
now there that think to who your favoured .
now , every hero of seems has their 100 fan .
- ! and for listen to stas mikhailov they for thousands !
- will to it the devotes , there works the sphere sexo-social .
and to a event cultural will 300 people , 10 billion never come . as result , least management , least money , all . marchita .
i to my fan , what more important is not deceive , not to to lose what that olivier achieved .
when was young was such tables that a coleccionista the tenia your in the wall the on of falk and larionov .
i i with fade , with the that for what general the people stops .
now to often who the concepts .
say culture spiritual , culture of consumption .
not there no culture in the consumption , that is other history .
i i a man of the culture of yesterday , crecí under the example of artists that living in the poverty and died in the poverty , . obstruct the money only for paint tables .
i i to favour of this culture .
- kirill , ? what is what that you lack to st petersburg ?
- good experts in culture .
there a concept : official of the culture .
but not all them can their to the culture .
when the on were the right all was of other way , the on such time not seaports very well the culture , but they that was necessary keep to the experts right .
in moscow now there very good consultants .
we people in st petersburg that well could be experts , but are closed , because . need experts to a level higher that nevertheless that to they and them open way .
now is prosperando the will personal policing .
what same erarta , but the difference is that them say honestly that not all the art modern is accepted , there some artists that have that to other museums .
- ? what is for you st petersburg ?
- st petersburg not is a capital cultural . in moscow there very more culture , there there ground .
but on our stones is difficult that the art &apos;s .
need ground cultural and we now more writers that readers , this is wrong .
in europe there a lot of people with curious that is to exhibitions and concerts .
in our case , this class is tiny .
we that to that the art is of fashionable , as what was to at the century last .
the project . implemented with a subsidy of st petersburg .
to to light in the space
the land is in danger .
warming global or clash with a asteroid murderer .
upgraded of losses space with human to board proceed in for of a planet of spare .
for keep the humanity . ago the question main : ? how continue the kind in conditions of cannot or in the same planet of spare ?
i that there little where choose .
of fact , only two are real planets that can be colonial , the least hipotéticamente .
&apos; these are venus and mars &apos; , says the scientists head the institute astronomic state , sternberg p.K. ( iAES ) , vladimir surdin .
but if the conditions in mars are best for the life , in the surface of venus the temperature is of 500 degrees .
only . can live to large altitudes or in the from of venus ... in the space .
. started to address the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora .
ago already a century that . were to out experiments with plants .
four generations of peas cultivados in from not . differed in nothing of the varieties outlaw .
after wine the rearing of insects in the from , small crack of the fruit , the drosófilas .
in 1979 . submitted the space eggs of codorniz for check how . develops the embryo in conditions of cannot .
helps as result a polluelo normal .
but then start the problems .
&apos; the problem is in that this polluelo has that find support , must in on their own feet and start to ! &apos; , explains vladimir sychev , the director the laboratory the institute of problems biomédicos ( iPBM ) of the academy of sciences of russia .
the not find support , the polluelos by volteretas the gambling .
and after of 10 hours in the would babies . was a atrofia total of the prompts .
the polluelos not ecu to the light not the audio .
and the unfortunately was that the out of four days simply . died .
&apos; and two sometimes we that born the polluelos , but then what stop because was impossible work there with them &apos; , , observing vladimir sychev on failure the experiment with the polluelos in the space .
the last time that a &apos; miniarca &apos; biological did to the from was ago 16 years .
in the spring the 2013 foreseeable the experiments .
, however , in the biosatélite &apos; bion &apos; only travel species of a same sex .
there a experiment with rats , that were settlement the space already with foetuses .
in principle , not . found nothing sobrenatural .
&apos; this was precisely in the biosatélites , but this was a experiment only , and studies as this must be to out &apos; , observing vladimir sychev .
after the landing , the asked space had offspring .
, however , still not . has managed address the problem of the reproduction directly in the space .
is a challenge difficult .
the animals , the lose their habitat her , simply not can to their your sexual .
the man , , however , to difference of the small animals , in principle , can .
the homo sapiens has the reasoning abstract and is capable of create a fund emotional appropriate .
experiments similar not . have to out for reasons ethical .
but the women travel the space since ago already 50 years .
the greater risk what happened tereshkova .
and what more precious that has the humanity is the body female .
our gaviota fly , and nobody in the land could say : if is after of a flight the space .
will or not have a baby after of this flight .
&apos; after of all , to this question nobody has would &apos; , observing the contractor the sector aerospace vakhtang vachnadze .
in june of 1964 , only after of a year the flight the space , the first woman cosmonauta , valentina tereshkova , was to light to a daughter .
the father of the girl , andrian nikolayev , was also cosmonauta .
in 1988 , the second woman cosmonauta , svetlana savitskaya , who two sometimes was in from and even worked in the space open , had a son .
, however , the risk there .
we few , are wall the astronauts to who after of long flights all them has result well , and a generation healthy next growing .
&apos; and if . can say more , is dangerous even in flights orbitales &apos; , sums the pilot cosmonauta , hero of the union soviet , hero of russia , valery polyakov .
, however , the humanity must to some new to in the biotechnology , in the protection radiation , in the creation of the serious artificial .
the hidrolaboratorio the centre of preparation of cosmonautas is a stage compulsory in the preparation for the flight .
in conditions of flotabilidad would , the cosmonautas profess their skills of work in the space .
the water simula the cannot .
if for a adult the water is a environment comfortable , although still hostile , for a child would born is their element home .
the small hombres-anfibio seem confirm that the life in the land about the ocean .
there a connection between the fact of that the baby . - approximately 9 months within of their mother in the tanks amniótico , therefore you will more easy used then the water .
in principle , this is logical , because since the at the birth to the at the first one spend only 2 weeks .
&apos; this is very little for forget something &apos; , says marina aksenova , monitora of swimming of would babies .
in short , if the cannot is a state more natural for a would born , for the women is necessary the gravitación , the force of the serious .
in the cannot the truly abdominales and of the pelvis . decrepitan very quickly , the capacity of expulsion the experiments . reduces .
good , omitimos that , by in the action of encouraging for the childbirth .
. can , for course , to to light in a house special , this what empujará .
&apos; ? and then what ? &apos; , valeri polyakov . ago this original question .
for other part , the child also needs serious artificial .
, the that of serious , the body not generated the heal not the system muscle .
to a would born in from is impossible vestirlo with a suit special for entrenamientos , as to the adults .
simply . you time of what that is vital for he .
&apos; and this experiment that we to to together , the allow the birth of a child in a environment strange , will place to that traigamos to the land to a disabled , to a person completely suit &apos; , for the head the committee of bioethics-related the institute of problems biomédicos of the academy of sciences of russia , igor pestov .
for now , the birth of children in the space is a question theoretical .
, however , with the time this will a reality , when the beings human in their losses . associated to a planet ago that will the home for their children babies in the space .
head of nKÚ : the inspection the system &apos; švarc &apos; not has given with the political guilty
in on of tenders public , the republic czech account with good inspectors and a legislation of quality , although their implementation cojea .
so what says miloslav kala , vice-president of the office of control by ( nKÚ ) in a interview for aktuálně.cz.
&apos; the law never will perfect &apos; , but their implementation must be right . &apos; this is , in my opinion , what that we lack &apos; , so describes the situation current .
the controls joint of the inspectors czech and germans also they to conclusions similar .
as example of a practice wrong , mentions the attitude of petr nečas towards the system of be be only on the role , that . known as the system &apos; švarc &apos; .
the first minister said recently that the ods ( party democratic civic ) not molestaría to the employers with inspectors . then , ? is ban or allowed ?
&apos; the law must be campaigns of some way and if prohibits something , in that case , not the president the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls not demand obligations &apos; , complaints kala .
in the meeting of the commission of control in the congress of the members , ud. spoke the project common between the team czech and the german , in the framework the which . morin the legislation which to the tenders public in both countries .
? what is exactly ?
. is of a control parallel that are to to ago a two years .
said of way simplified : the legislation european regulariza how . must organise the tenders public , to this you still the legislation existing in every country and , after , the these in yes .
us what we uk all and , although the control still not has complete , we obtained differences very interesting . generally , the legislation of our country is &apos; more strict and more full &apos; , , however , the these concrete in some parameters is better in germany .
. confirms , therefore , that not enough with integrate rules every time more stricter , but that is necessary focus in the implementation of the law same .
? what can to of fact this project ? ? what believes that are the conclusions ?
precisely a control common of this kind could make to that we of invest efforts in the that of the laws , the reduction and the improvement of the limits , although this not have a impact so positive .
the economy the savings means to a thing appropriate to a price reasonable ( what that not always means that the price be the more under ) for avoid so the enrichment and , to the long , the actions criminal .
but not for the fact of reduce the limit of the tenders to say that we to this .
perhaps because the system is surplus with therefore &apos; tape &apos; , that those that want to failures in the system will do more easily that if the limits . maintained so higher as now .
ud. about of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the prácticaa of the tenders public .
? how works the system of controls in germany ?
? is a office analogous to our nKÚ or . &quot; of other way ?
in how to the offices , as the nKÚ , there it the bundesrechnungshof ( court federal of accounts ) , with a organisation similar to the our , with a school also , what only is that in their case is structured of a way a therefore different , but in principle both offices evolve parallel .
also the powers are to true point analógas , , however , in therefore that germany has a organisation federal , the courts of accounts . are even to this level . in this aspect from slightly of our system .
the court federal of accounts ( bRH ) only can control the money federal , what that here call funds state .
the funds public , that are administered for the regions and the municipalities , there , in germany , . monitored in the court federal of accounts .
in as to the legislation local , ? is more simple that the our ?
for what general , not i like establish a compared , data specific . not however , germany still being a model in some aspects , but not . can must with what in what is better .
? could be better , for example , in as to the quality of the inspectors ?
that sure that not , but , repeat , not i like to this kind of comparisons .
is necessary say that even those countries that we as model must to with to a great number of problems .
if not outside so , not them contribute no benefit cooperate with our office , ? not believes ?
in as to the legislation of our country , ? what meant for their office the amendment of law on the tenders public ? ? . world of some way their impact ?
taking in account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short , still not . has said in the actions of control .
given that time controls former post , is be have with a true delay .
for now , . is in the process of preparation of the controls future : we on a new tool of &apos; detection of risks not economic &apos; , for the that we fact to almost nearby tenders public , that have been considered . the changes . will perfectly about here , already that . modify the limits , . rectifican the conditions of some types the process of selection and similar .
? as that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that , more well , is a patchwork for the system bureaucratic ?
i that this law is surely a step in the direction right and i that so be .
the problem that can emerge is that the regulation &apos; . glad &apos; and that be impossible must .
already with the regulation previous , the people controlled were linked the contractor ( for example , in the case of the programmes operational regional the council regional ) , and every law not respected in on of tenders public mean the violation of the discipline budgetary .
? has sense then tighten the law of this way ?
i that not of this way .
the system must from to those that want atacarlo or profit of he and not punish to those that commit a failure formal , that not has impact in the decision-making of decisions .
a system of this kind only will create a greater pressure bureaucratic .
? and how . its of this ?
will towards where we has this way on .
the first minister has declared recently that the ods not molestaría to the employers with controls the called system švarc , with reference the fact of be be only on the role . ? what means this ?
? the system švarc &apos; is ban or allowed ?
the law must be campaigns of some way and , if prohibits something , then not even the first minister the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls and demand obligations .
can say : &apos; cambiamos the law and what allowing &apos; , but not can say that we as if nothing .
in the law on the tenders public , the regulation is quite strict in as the way in that . must act formally . and so is as must be for protect the competition public .
but , for another on , is tragic that . excluded the candidate with the better supply for not to the demands formal .
the law never will perfect , but their implementation must be right . this is , in my opinion , what that we lack .

. says that in little least of a month is to to the end the world , ? what view on this ?
only is a of between many other news alarmist to the that we like ultimately .
the group of music the tap tap we like more well to jokes on this and we like say that we the only group of music the world that manages together enough energy positive for postpone the end the world or for prevent .

? to who . you happened this idea ?
p.m. was idea my , after we forjando the project all together with our leather honza augusta .
also of to together enough energy positive and avoid the end the world , also we think , together with the society , on the state in that we the world to our children .
with occasion the end the timetable maya also we created a now only of articles : you , t-shirts , combined and original llaveros against the end the world that can year in www.e-tap.cz , other way of safely .
the group the tap tap , together with other interpreters , also sung the called anthem against the end the world , that has for title &apos; end the world , cancelled &apos; .
currently is very popular in youtube , ? . will hear in the concerts efforts ?
clear that yes , and will fair the last , good , always that all from well and not . an the world ...

the himnos . enlazarán between yes slaughters thank to the europe-wide special in direct in the television czech .
tomáš hanák has writing the lyrics of this song and belonging the role leading of jesus in the videoclip , where also along xindl x ...
? how about this cooperation ?
we together even with other personalities of the scene cultural czech , from of organise many acts efforts and concerts ...
our all our as in participate in this project .
. has shown that to the majority of them them interested and them divierte work with us .
? to what . will the money youngsters in the concerts against the end the world ?
to equipment for the centre education , barriers studeo , that have to term in their sixth year running with the partnership civil tap in jedličkův ústav .
the a of the school of jedličkův ústav receive regularly the visit of teachers with the that out activities entertaining and interesting .
the a not have of media economic enough for pay to the teachers and we a efuerzo for do possible .
in the framework of the completion of the works in jedličkův ústav , will a building independent the that we trasladaremos with this project .
in every of act several groups and interpreters .
? what are the criteria of selection ?
tries european a programme that be attractive for all the generations , including the children .
for example , in prague actuarán chinaski , support lesbiens , illustratosphere with are bárta , the tap tap , marián bango and paroubek suchý .
for obtain information more detailed , &quot; put www.kpks.cz.
? you measures any other &apos; action witnessed &apos; similar in the future ?
in may we for first time in the festival pražské jaro , so that here surely preparing a programme attractive with invited interesting .
the year that next also we like play in the bohemian national calculating of new york and to me , personally , as that we in states united , i like amplify with actions in washington and in chicago .
vuestros plans in the abroad not are precisely minimalistas , to now you action for example in madrid , brussels , london or moscow .
the tap tap is , not however , a group have for people with disabilities .
? how is the logistical and the organisation of these travel ?
not is so difficult how can appear to first view .
there five member in wheelchair of wheelchair we , the chairs must travel in the fitted for luggage and also have a weight , the boxes with the instruments ...
, however , to now we the we managed well . čSA and british major were perfectly prepared , thing that not is of puzzles .
even in moscow , of where we their ago little , went all , problems .
thank to the check-out the abroad &quot; for the different attitudes of the society towards the disabled and other aspects .
? with what you you found to now ?
in madrid , luxembourg , london and other cities , all works better that here ; in russia we been witnessing of that , in the this , is a way for go .
to difference of prague , moscow is full of barriers , there still , be often that a person . properly single for the centre of the city in a wheelchair of wheelchair we .
something so aware as is , for example , to preference to someone in wheelchair of wheelchair in lift , there not what is .
for fortunately , . has created a partnership civil that . intensive for tematizar the problems of the people with disabilities .
? in what aspects we take example of countries more progressive ?
there many aspects in the that we for behind ...
but is important mention that the as and the improvement of the situation always on of the people to the that affects directly .
in london and in madrid is very normal that the people with a disabilities serious . properly for their account in public and can go the service , the museum , where wants ...
but not is very common that a great number of people with disabilities obtain in the life social of way active , in this aspect , with the tap tap ! we a little for front !
a society environmentally-friendly or , barriers is a thing , but when it the at in the that establishment eminent athletes , artists , players , political or lawyers , start to change all of truth .
to now , are cases isolated of people that have a great force of will .
the group the tap tap is currently very popular , but if at a years back , ? what you was to be the group in 1998 ?
there as educador in jedličkův ústav , where had very people young to my around that wanted their to something .
and since that i i musician , toco , between other , the saxofón , fundé a group healthier with a about of work .
and with the time , as says our mediating láďa angelovič , . we was a little of the hands ( laughter ) .
, however , the popularity not came to these last years , ? or i wrong ?
is truth that we helped quite the fact of connecting with singers famous and also work actively for twenty-first the group .
we to the conclusion of that the work that not . is , is as if not existed .
thank to the aid of the union european , we afford also teachers of quality , equipment , etc
? belong intention of to so far with the tap tap ?
since the principle i the potential that had , that . can to something of another way .
the world the spectacle is full of things that . seem the a to the other .
is logical , to their way , all what new . welcomes with caution and it a time in accepted .
there few things extraordinary , but i dare to say that the tap tap is a of them .
the impression of someone that we is for first time is clearly the compassion , is a reaction natural ...
but the compassion is completely superfluous because the people with disabilities not are beings ruins that suffer and of the that we have compassion .
there people that is capable of live a life full and develop , with the condition , for course , of that he of the media necessary .
i always i that if something them its well to people with disabilities , then , not is only a progress for them , but for all the society .
? helped the fact of that is ud. a head assignment , as you describes very people ?
if we to a work of quality , we that be rigorous in many aspects and demand certain discipline .
i that is completely normal .
some people they with a vision romantic and with the head in the clouds and when . they that have that come two days to experimenting , go to the test preparatory and to a time travelling and in concerts , the euphoria initial them or quickly .
but so is how works in all parties , in every group that to work and to something .
currently the group the tap tap has twenty member .
? many of them were already in the beginning the year 1998 ?
only one : láďa angelovič .
we a group open , the people will and its , not . can avoid .
who have will and wish heart always the doors open
will the day before the expected end the world , the thursday 20.12.2012 to the 21 hours
will place in the incheba bit of prague , in fléda of brno and in plynojem in ostrava and attending 12 groups and other musicians of the republic czech
the three cities . conectarán the end of the evening to through of video for i together the song the group the tap tap &apos; end the world , cancelled &apos;
the aim the of is together the resources necessary for funding equipment multi-functional the centre education , barriers sTUDEO in jedličkův ústav of prague , whose cost out to 25 million of billion czech .
the entry the of costs 400 cZK and the children to 12 years have entry free in the option of sale early in bohemiaticket
poland and the manage .
in the meeting of ministers of the countries of the agency space european held the week last . accepted to poland as twelfth member of the esa . is the second country member of the esa the former bloc of europe the this , after of the republic czech , that . became in member plenary the 12 of november of 2008 ) .
poland set a intensive cooperation with the esa in the year 1994 and for the years subsequent part in the commission of projects of the agency .
, however , the way of poland towards the manage began a before .
the enthusiasts poles already . son to the flights the space before of the second war world , although not always . about their work .
i , for example , the conference of by šternfeld in the centre astronomic of warsaw in the that , the 6 of december of 1933 , presented their ideas on the study pioneering &apos; introduction to the cosmonautics &apos; .
the ideas the young engineering ( born the 1905 ) was to the assistants indifferent and , years after , šternfeld had that the dr jan gadomski had been the only that had shown interest in their work .
in the year 1934 šternfeld successful in france the prize robert esnault-Pelterie and andré louis as for their &apos; introduction to the cosmonautics &apos; .
the doctor jan gadomski ( 1899 - 1966 ) , mentioned before , . became more later in a great drive of the astronomy and of the cosmonautics .
published hundreds of articles in weeklies polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this discipline scientific .
gadomski . became in a undisputed of the cosmonautics , was known in all the world and their contribution to the science . was rewarded when . it their name to one of the cráteres of the face hidden of the moon .
already in the year 1925 . was in poland a dresina that was to be sanctioning of a engine of rockets .
unfortunately , . unknown who was the author of the proposal and not . know the destalles the project .
not is clear if the lift-off was to be used for the cold-start of the dresina or for their slowed .
the information on this dresina . limited to the after in the press of the time .
to from the year 1933 the artillery polish began to their to the rockets .
the research was funded for the komórka techniki uzbrojenia in cooperation with the prof . mieczyslawem wolfkem and prof . gustawem mokrzyckiegim .
to from the material internationally , . ago clear that the research came the there of the evidence practices .
not however , with the arrival of the troops german , . was the research .
in the year 1937 about in the press specialised the classic of a missile of hunting fotoeléctrico designed for the engineering rohoziński and the year next was published the study &apos; rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza &apos; , the author leliwa-Krzywoblocki .
both projects were for the use military of the engines for rockets .
little before of the war , the committee advisory scientific provisional ( tymczasowy komitet doradczo-Naukowy ) . responsible of all the projects of technical of rockets for use military and coordinaba all the jobs .
the committee was founded in owned , but after of two years of activity , . was interrupted for the beginning of the war .
other studies dedicated to the cosmonautics appeared in the press polish after of the war thank the work of the society polish of astronáutica ( polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne ) .
in the edition of november of 1954 of the magazine problemy . ago reference for first time to the society with four articles very far-reaching dedicated to the astronáutica .
in one of them , the prof . m. subotowicze , . proposed the creation of a society that . devoted to the cosmonautics .
in that time already . had since in up projects of satellite artificial and was obvious that the research cosmic was a discipline with prospects of future .
since principles of 1956 the society polish of astronáutica ( pTA ) hoped to be part of the federation international of astronáutica ( up in 1951 ) and in autumn of that same year the pTA . became in member plenary .
the year next the first president of the pTA , kazimierz zarankiewicz ( 1902 - 1959 ) , happened to be the vice-president of the federation international of astronáutica .
occupy this office to their death in 1959 .
to from the 1956 , the pTA part of way significantly in the development the lift-off probe rM ( rakieta meteorologiczna ) , that was a success and . became in the first lift-off polish in the that . was to out research scientific .
the first kind rM-1 was complete in 1957 and . launched for first time the 10 of october of 1958 .
the lift-off had a for of 1.8 metres , a 80 stated of length and not unable to the 5 kg of weight .
more later , . end of build the version rM-1A and in summer of 1959 . were the evidence airlines of the rockets rM-2 of two stages in the desert of błędów .
the lift-off severs 1.4 metres and pesaba a 11.5 kilo
another kind of lift-off in development was to be subject of study scientific real . the lift-off rM-34 was to have a for of 14,5 km and their mission would control the wind of all .
, however , in 1962 . were the jobs .
the successor of the first rockets the kind rM was the lift-off meteor-1 , that . was for the years 1962 and 1965 .
. diseñó as lift-off of two stages , with a length total of 510 swimming and a weight initial of 32.5 kilo
. proceeded three types ( called meteor-1A , -1B and -1C ) , that . differed between yes for the space available for the equipment scientists .
in the lift-off meteor-1A the space available for the volume was of 0.4 litres , in the meteor-1B of 0,34 litres and in the meteor-1C of 0,62 litres .
the for maximum in the three types was of 37 km
between the years 1965 and 1968 . developed in the institute air the lift-off meteor-2 , whose first evidence airlines . were in october of 1970 .
the lift-off meteor-2 had a weight initial of 380 kg and was capable of to a weight useful of 10 kg to 60 km of all .
subsequently . was the version meteor-2H and meteor-3 .
is necessary mention also the entry of poland in the cOSPAR ( society for space roslin ) in the year 1960 and the training the committee national of cOSPAR two years after .
in the framework the programme interkosmos , poland . joined to the research the space cósmico on satellite artificial soviet and , in the year 1978 , the pilot polish miroslaw hermaszewski . became in the second intercosmonauta after of vladimir remek .
the from of the law on jobs social not is the solution .
the week last the who constitutional suspended the law traabajos social .
the resolution adherents a prevents discussion in the society .
since then will interesting at the commission existing since a point of view more broader .
the systems economic liberals in the eu , as that in the world globalised , . based in the principle of a greater competition economic and least regulation .
in result , this means that the different forms economic and the systems economic national are in conflict permanent between yes .
the cause . is in the principle the free trade and the movement free and unlimited of capital private , together with the speculation financial unbridled .
the effect of the large differences in the cost labour ( of the wages ) is tensions economic .
under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer , with the imports of goods cheap , is shorten travel and for this &apos; from a bajadda &apos; the price the competitor with the aim of done with the greater part the market and , of this way , increase their for of profits .
to great at means , for the majority of the employers , enterprises the production the abroad , buy there more cheap or well as . the result is a unemployment high in those countries in the that the price the work , in compared with other economies , is more high .
because to that the capital private not has responsibility social any and , with this , not is responsible the unemployment that this phenomenon generated , overall necessarily the expenditure social the state .
all this situation being the total desirable of the employers for pay tax and compensate the damage economic and social that have caused in their now of obtain profits .
the situation is universally so known that not is necessary it data statisticians specific .
the practices little escrupulosas the capital private do situations , in certain economies , in the that the governments of these countries . are forced to compete with the aim of reduce artificially the level social of the own population and , of this way , attract capital abroad the country .
said of other way , the governments are capital private to available of their own population , have in account the decline social .
this . ago patent on all in the changes of the laws force .
the aim is force to the population to that accept the dictated the capital private , on all in what that as to the wages .
this has place , for a part , by the system of duty economic in the case of unemployment of long long-term ; for other , by the right restricted of the employees in as to rights labour .
the result is a poverty growing together with the increase of the differences between poor and rich .
since ago a series of years , there in germany points of over of food for people poor that not can in with their own work .
the number of people that receive this kind of aid is already the million .
in the framework the increase of the competitiveness of the economy german , . is a case quite often : people employed with a wage so under that the state must pay the rest for to the minimum essential for survive .
. was public a scandal of this kind related with the situation of the employees diagnoses the parliament federal german .
the measures of savings of virtually all the states the southern of the eu gets , , place to doubt , to the same situation . the people , repeated for a decline abismal of their level social , . are forced to must as in the century 19th or to malvivir with a wage rotten in the limit of the society , with the hope of that some day it the country capital investor private .
? is necessary preguntrarse of where next ?
in the case of that . involved of other countries of the eu , then the poverty is of a country to another or not is never , since that chinese , indian , face , turks , &quot; , egyptians or african are working for a tiny part of a wage european .
this also affects to all america latin .
the bilbao liberals and the media of communication claim to the all that the state not should to capital to the economy , that you the economy leads to their failure .
the capital private stand with tooth and european the would of that the state not should intervene in the economy entrometiéndose in the control .
to continuation , is necessary ask if the capital private not play with their egoism in the up policy and , for therefore , in all the state .
in this case the answer is clearly terms .
the test is the existence of lobbies , in the practice very powerful and curse , in all the states .
the result is a situation some that . world in the area of the corruption , in the favours mutual , in a legislation that is virtually reprehensible in all parties but not is a .
in germany the situation is the next : the ministries state , to lack of media financial , are the significant of projects of law to companies legal private , the which are to often linked with the industry .
this kind of projects of law are adopted after in the bundestag , the parliament german .
of this way , all the power not from the people , such and as . is in the constitutions of the democracies western , but of the strong groups financial that for their own interests .
is obvious that the democracies with a it liberal . are quickly in a situation how the that describes appiános in their labour the crisis of the republic roman in times of caesar and pompeya : &apos; the state was time desintegrándose and the administrations . high-ranking to the force &apos; .
to change of bribery , lobbies overall ilegítimamente and aid for funding stones or swords .
the using and the corruption . spread , from one and the people on to the ballot with the vote apalabrado of advance &apos; ... &apos; not had people with nature that aspirara to a since in the administration , so that a time , to cause of this disorganisation , the state was eight months , best-case &apos; ... &apos; began to hutu in seriously of that the only no for a situation so serious was the autocracy and that was necessary decisions a man extremely &apos; ... although appiános i in pompeya , caesar by the power and taskforce the democracy for always in autocracy .
the conclusion , the same way that in the old , is that the society current . on in preferences discredit the benefit individual , have in account the interests common .
the capital private not is capable , in their essence , of understand and risk the profits of all the society .
the result is the same that the of then , a quickly of the elite , unprecedented , , that . she a effort for them in depth .
the causes the on of the regimes fascist and communist must other , for what therefore , in the liberalisation unbridled of the systems economic in the century 19th and 20th .
with respect to the situation current , is possible be the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of kind liberal , as a pause criticise , to the expected the next coup .
the fact really demoledor is that the elite current ignores for completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives , disasters social and humanitarian of the that we been witnessing , so as the crimes against the humanity , such and as the we in the history former and the more recent .
the from of the law on tenders public not is the solution ; the least not to long long-term .
under pressure of the competition economic , therefore to level international as within of the eu , the government of the republic czech . be forced to to for other to for reduce the level social of the population .
this trend is , for what therefore , systemic .
the solution is for reforms sociopolíticas specific , that strengthen therefore the participation the capital the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and that weaken the position of monopoly the capital private in the society in benefit the state .
israel : the laboratory the chaos .
&apos; that nothing comes reducing violence and nothing ever could &apos; ( not from nothing of the violence and nothing could do ) , sting in their song fragile and whose estribillo himself &apos; cleanup &apos; &apos;s do not forget how fragile we are &apos; ( not we forget of what fragile that we ) .
&apos; if my children not is wars , not would no &apos; gutele schnaper , wife of mayer amschel rothschild , in their bed of death in the year renown .
after of the last waves of violence between israel and the strip of gaza , have that , as always , reactions various .
a , the on of israel , it to favour the right of self-defence and encasilla to the palestinians in the role of terrorists . the other supports to the palestinians and allegedly racism for part the state of israel , genocide by against arab palestinians and asylum-seekers to israel of state terrorist .
not i to in who is guilty of the massacres that . are regular and who is the victim . the end and the out , the citizens of today in day of israel , including the territories self-employed , born within of the situation policy current and not lived the beginning of the violence .
my intention is offer to the readers a look behind the curtain , a look for be who out from of the tensions that . unsatisfactory since ago 95 years ( calculated to from of the declaration balfour in november of 1917 ) in a small surface of land the east a .
some of my considerations . based in facts historical , other in conclusions to the that i come on the basis of my own way of understand the issue , on who or what group of people is the drive main of the events of the history modern .
in the history of the humanity the history of the struggles for the power is in first class .
in every time we find a great great or a rostopchine .
but what that already not is so clear is if always were these - the that with their steps of way deliver or if behind of their charles had someone that orientaba their actions towards a particular aim .
we accept that we in a time that on the wealth the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this means , not . has been to in a single generation .
of between these families astronómicamente richest least a that could be the more prominent ( if still there someone behind , not what i , but not what may ) : the rothschild .
not . says a to close of them .
course .
in the years 90 the century 19th bought the first agency of news ( jazeera ) for that any of with their name with acts criminal of very serious . the power and the wealth , or both , them existence the back , thing that for them always meant a just .
have participating important in almost all the banks central the world and in those countries in the that not are represented , . has declared or . is for a war : before the attack to afghanistan were 7 countries , after the attack of iraq were 5 , after of bring to gaddafi only they four , but meanwhile russia has counts the bank central the government russian .
all at that has tried against to this family has died .
was is . refused to renew the state the bank central bank of america of the rothschild , began for the war of secession to this money and was murdered in is in the theatre .
stored started to this money and wanted decision the system of reserve federal ( states ) and was murdered in 1963 ; the congresista louis mc fadden was poisoned the year sprinter after of to exceeding to the states for have outrage the great crisis economic the year 1929 .
their now for the power world them was for the years 1859 - 1871 to out a plan with three wars world , designed for the masón starie pike , &apos; with the degree 33 .
the first war . espoused as aim eliminate the large states monárquicos in all europe ; the second wanted eliminate the was colonial , especially of great britain , and the third . proposed reduce the population of the land between a million and billion million of people ( such amount of slave for their welfare and luxury would and not consumirían many resources ) , also of the creation of a religion universal ( the ecumenismo not is nothing more that a draft for such solution ) and the adoption final of the powers six-month .
the method with the that operates the group of the families more richest , together with the rothschild , still the dynamic the releasing of crisis and the of send of a solution ( order ab cao - order to from the chaos ) .
these solutions are , , however , flawed , and threat always a worsening of the situation . if not , enough remember that the states was created for that not . repetition a crisis as the the year 1907 .
so that , after the success the murder the as the charles elicited , which ferdinand , in sarajevo and after of that , to as of this , . erupted the first war world , terrible the russia having with the beginning of the revolution defended .
the first war world over of way makeshift and unjustified since the point of view military and economic , the capitulation of germany ( the wars for end with the russia having were already unnecessary ) and the of country of the great power of europe central , the empire austro-Húngaro .
for preparation the ground of the second war world , allowed that the bankers and political palette , of way bloodless , a situation over to as of the enormous – of war imposed on germany , with what that . were the conditions a for the radicalisation of the mass impoverished . subsequently , them sufficient with them to the germans the solution the führer , that was what enough strong and simple and that to guilty , and build after a czechoslovakia an for several and with a strong minority german that should represent and when so well the role of the fifth spine , that prendió the is and resulted the outbreak of the war .
the end the century 19th , the rothschild impulsaron the foundation the movement sionista , a an that hoped to the training of a state jewish , out in the region of the former judea with jerusalem as capital ( return the sión ) .
the declaration non-jewish this before laid the foundations for the immigration mass of jews to palestine and they the first conflicts with the population arab the place .
. were attacks terrorists in both parties .
estalló the second war world : is difficult know if hitler promptly too of the be to the that what they control the bankers international in a principle or if all what that was was part of a plan . , however , the suffering of the jews european in the camps of concentration was the conditions a for the acceptance the state jewish in the society world .
israel was founded officially in displacement and , of way similar the way in that the – of war imposed to germany emerge the way towards the second war world , with the proclamation the state of israel . was the globe for a third war .
if the bankers international succeed iniciarla , the nation jewish , the as that in the second war world , . would in victim in first line of which , now together with the population arab or , generally , muslim the east a .
israel is a laboratory in , a machine of solder and chaos , not only in the framework of their country , but also to at international . take as example how . into of way totally the a and opponents of israel .
? who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict israeli-palestinian ? ? where the injustice marginalization injustice in a spiral of violence tackle , if the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their now for the power world ?
in this point is necessary distinction between the inhabitants of israel and their authorised , because , the as that is in our country , the bankers international only have to their candidates in the elections .
the current president of israel b. netanyahu is the typical example of political fascist , marketing to the bankers international , that ago all what possible for on the war to iran and , recital that iran is member of the organisation of cooperation of shanghai ( china , india , russia , pakistan ... ) , threaten in become in a conflict global and , if we in account that iran controls the close of ormuz , for where is the 20 % of all the oil world ( the corridor of navigation has only two miles of wide ) , would to the destruction of the economy world .
under what light . show now the words that them david rockefeller in 1994 : &apos; what only that need is a crisis general and the people will of agreement with a new order world . &apos;
the new order world in their imagination is a world of mr and slave .
a world in the that the rest of the population it to a handful of people that are part of the aristocracy financial well accommodated .
a world in the that to every new individual . you up a chip the been that controls all their be .
&apos; and forced to all , small and large , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a mark in the hand right or in the with , to not power buy not sell , to not be that will the name of this monster or the figures of their name .
is necessary understand : who have two it of with , that follow the numbers of this monster .
the number mark to the person and this number is seiscientos sixty and six &apos; .
film - : if . being oil , have to hollywood
in november of 1979 a group of the demonstration of students islamists took the embassy american in tehran and took 52 diplomados as hostage .
their we in freedom was to be to change the destronado shah mohamed réza páhlevi , the which after of the revolution pamuk to usa , country that had patrocinado their regime for decades .
for the administration american the situation not themselves no perspective positive : bath-water the shah for the be not . what could allow , since that , if what was , were in danger the confidence of their allies in other countries .
but the we in freedom of the hostage in iran , where the revolution had led in the constitution the regime theocratic , not was to their reach .
was a coup the prestige of the states united , that subsequently . valencia still more with the attempt failed of release to the hostage for the force .
the diplomats they were released 444 days after of the intervention negotiating the government of algeria .
in us , their destination horrible a wave of solidarity and bear against iran .
the failure in iran played of way decisive to the defeat of jimmy jimmy with reagan ronald in the elections presidential of 1980s .
the film &apos; - &apos; the director and actor ben affleck tematiza a episode of this history , that cosechó a small success for america .
little before of should the embassy , . escaped six employees the building .
after of a complicated periplo , ended in the residence of the embassy canadian .
cia , in cooperation with the authorities canadians , managed extract of iran , for this helped a history via a point extravagante : forthcoming with passports canadians , as member the team film that at the in in the country for the making of a excessive of science fiction .
combination of up
the plan that bourlanges the expert in &apos; exfiltración &apos; toni mendez be the cooperation of hollywood .
for that the lie existence publicising , . wrote on the project film in weeklies specialist , . organised conferences of press , the society of production virtual had even a clearance real .
the details on the operation . together in secret for a time , the film . has fact to from of the memories of tony mendez .
the film of affleck is a combination odd of several up .
for a on , a thriller political realistic ; for another , a called &apos; caper movie &apos; , the history of a episode that went well , a deception ( a example can be the series ocean &apos; &apos;s push ) .
in the film . combined the states of mind . we for a on secuencias well it of tehran . in the sequence of appropriations . show photographs flagship of the time of the events , that were plasmados the same way in the film ; not there many differences to this regard .
for the another , scenes well-known of hollywood a therefore more livianas , marked for the irony and a corner excessive .
and also , scenes of the central of the cia and other institutions : men trajeados that you the situation in the table of negotiations , in the corridors of the office , for telephone ...
ben affleck has managed restart their career of a way excellent .
the actor , that had been subject of ridiculed , . has become in a director on and their way of act has longer of be the white of comments appreciates .
- is their third largometraje , after of &apos; goodbye small , goodbye &apos; ( 2007 ) and the thriller &apos; the town . city of honour &apos; ( 2010 ) .
the same time , is the first film of affleck in the that the action not has place in the city of boston , where . it .
also , the sensitivity of warrant the atmosphere the place was a feature that light to the directors of films old for above of standards of hollywood .
and affleck what shows in - , where tehran . &apos; wheel &apos; in canada .
the best scenes of the film have place in the streets , in the reconstruction of the events reported . the sequence introductory of the decision-making of the embassy is impressive for their capacity sinóptica that , the same time , trasmite the ambivalent the confusion and of the lack of foresight that from when , in some place , the history it a step forward .
affleck and their colleagues obtaining a effect similar in the scenes proceeded ( the team impostor in the bazaar of tehran ) .
too action in many places
the director had that accept the fact of that a history explained not offers a in the sense film of the scenes more penalised .
and . the you quite well . to sometimes you adds something to the reality : here not its all of way so you ( the scene in that which the crisis in the airport of tehran , the handicap of a so-called to america and the for unbridled after their back . become in a madness ) .
the flaqueza of - is the havoc that from of the need of show too action in many places .
alan arkin and john goodman have a role very funny as colleagues of hollywood , although their - . deserved more space and not are , not a least , the only in this filme .
for these for , the film of affleck lose a little of further dramatic , but is a film that . can to with a interest moderate , appreciate their realisation and the lifestyle retro of a thriller that calls the years 70 .
but that . collapse , that will difficult .
as reminder of a history real and as test of what excessive that can be the concepts of omnipresencia and omnisciencia of the services secret , is enough .
rules for the inflado of much , bananas and circus
the servant www.bankovnipoplatky.com , that every year is a survey on the rates bank more absurd , now has decided announced the contest on &apos; the regulation or the ideas more absurd the workshop of the eu &apos; .
&apos; . we happened after the last event , the eu has to approve a share the 40 for % of women in jobs of direction in the large companies european &apos; , he právo bluntly nacher , the inflated of the survey .
between the absurdidades nominadas is , for example , the recent decision the court european of unifying the policies of insurance between men and women .
to now , the women . aventajaban of best prices in the insurance of life because for objective a risk will .
&apos; other ideas &apos;s the workshop of the eu can be proposals for the people to end of this year &apos; .
the election will place to end the month of february of 2013 &apos; , informed nacher .
between the regulations controversial of the eu is , for example , the addition compulsory of biocomponentes the fuel that , as result , harms the a environment ; other ban is the use of the thermometers of mercury of all the life only because contain a small amount of a substance dangerous or the deleted sombre the size of the cages of the hens , that has contributed the increase considerable the price of the eggs this year .
. has criticised the ban proving of use the expression &apos; butter of it &apos; or the withdrawal of the bill classical of the shops .
a banana of quality must have a length of 14 centimetres .
the would of the union decision-making this kind of decisions to often under the pressure of one or another lobby law or industrial , whose petitions in brussels are - normally for some state or group of states ( the republic czech , even with the threat of veto , eye the demands of their banks ) .
the interests of a lobby were behind of the request , for example , of that the bananas of greater quality be have in the eu a length of for what least 14 centimetres and not could it &apos; curvaturas sick &apos; .
the commission european . for saying that with this only search harmonisation the rules national not homogeneizadas to the date , that only complicaban their marketing .
the rules that do reference to fruit and vegetables in the eu , to despite of the opposition of some states , . have no on the basis of that the directive existing means a waste of grocery .
the candidate to win the survey could be the site of the eu the year last according the which in the much inflables that . market is compulsory have that the children under of 8 years not are authorised to inflarlos , the supervision of a adult .
the eu was reference here to a study american according the which , when . about of toys , the much are the main cause of death child for asphyxia .
also is existing a restriction similar applies the use of matasuegras for part of children of to 14 years .
ocurrencias curiosas born even in our country
also absurd is the regulation which to the officials european : all at that have any role official in the eu not can use the designation of macedonia . for not fine the sensitivity of greece , . must about of fyrom ( pointed pointed pointed of macedonia ) .
the servant bankovnípoplatky.com , in cooperation with the partnership of economists liberals laissez faire , nominó in the survey , between some proposals absurd mentioned more down , the site of the union on the volume of the has of food in the territory of a state member .
the eu determinó the volumes were of has of food that can technically in the territory of the republic czech the same day of our entry to the eu .
after , the republic czech estimated , for example , the volume established for setas in retains , what that you an a threat of fined substantial .
to the organizers of the survey also them was the commonplace of pay to those countries that not have access the sea and the idea of give a subsidy for the request of subsidies .
this class of ideas not arose in brussels but in prague .
&apos; we in disadvantage for the fact of not have sea .
we to the union european a compensation &apos; , declared in autumn the 2004 the then minister of agriculture jaroslav palas ( čSSD ) .
what destabilise with the fact of that in our country . was a crop and , as result of the so-called purchases of intervention , the state had the stores in and . had that export .
according palas , given that the republic czech is far of the ports seaports , the eu should pagarnos hundreds of million of eur .
the end , the commission european . was ready to help to the republic czech and organised a contest public for the buying the crop of the countries that not have access the sea .
the subsidy for receive a subsidy was proposal to the municipalities for the ministry for the development local at for the minister pavel němec ( uS-DEU ) . specifically , is an to the significant of applications of subsidies of brussels .
eu : the decided rare are a exception
the guidelines of the states member are to often white of criticisms , the efforts of the eu in on of regulations and , also , a functioning and development more they in all the union deserve more well , according several experts , our recognition .
according the experts , the problem more serious is , for example , the collection of subsidies of the eu for projects that not have nothing that see with the deepening of the integration european , but that the states member have managed in the negotiations on budgets .
to the czech also them is the very sensitive , the same way that to other countries of the union , the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their products traditional , although our country not always has out well of these pugnas .
the czech , after six years of disputes with germans and austrian , flank with success the designation of origin the requesón of olomouc , but had that christening the name the rum national , whose tradition in our country . back the century 19th , and happened to unfair &apos; tuzemák &apos; .
only the products processing to from the distilled of cane of sugar can be so-called rum , but not those facts to from of beet of sugar .
in the list official of geographical of origin protected of the eu , together with the fruits from and gorgonzola known in all the world , the mazapán of the city german lübeck or the parma of parma , already . are for example the biscuits of karlsbad karlsbad , the carpa of pohořelice and of třeboň and , even , the variety of hop of žatec .
as maras protected of the eu , will be proud the the bread of jengibre of pardubice and the karlsbad of hořice greens podkrkonoší .
the people to that barnabei the republic , but i a amateur , says okamura
mr senator , ? how . you happened stand to the elections for president ?
not . is of be senator or president .
if in our country outside all well , then not would my candidacy .
but already not i bear see how . stolen in the last twenty years in our country , how the honour are go , . increase the tax and the age of retirement .
not had ambitions of be political .
when i something that not i like , attempt to with a solution for amended .
and since that already i forty years and my candidacy is independent , the only possibility that i of change the things is coming as senator or president .
the senate already has come , but little after . has since in way towards the presidency .
? not is giving the on to those people that what have voted ?
always i that my candidacy to the presidency depended of the results in the elections the senate .
more later precisé that if on elected senator , would my candidacy to the presidency .
but my aim not is the role ; the role is the tool with the that i to reality my own ideas .
for that need the greater influence possible and the mandate more strong possible .
the problem not is only that us a nation that criticize in the bar or front of the television , but that pisoteamos to who that wants an a change .
to this . you are the media of communication , that you discredit and who the freedom of expression with the freedom of lie .
of me . says that i sobornado to journalists or that i been advisory of paroubek jiří .
we to about of their ideas .
. is to the fight presidential with would financial and responsibilities criminal of political and the declaration of the property for above of twenty million .
for this must change the law .
as president not has this competition and only the senate in their whole can propose laws .
? how to it ?
as citizen , i have part of a group of pressure for that the profession of guide . it as work be , and what we .
the problem is in the policy : if someone is with a good proposal , already be of right or of left , . this to purpose and this affects to the citizens .
as candidate independent , have of a greater potential for obtain the support of all the groups parliamentary .
, encasillamientos not undistorted of party , i the capacity of power decisions something of every party that be better for our country and apply .
? . as more well a man of right or of left ?
since the point of view czech , i the impression that the people i as more of left .
for me not has importance , already be a little of left or a little of right .
what that i care is that they forward .
not i care if someone is of right or of left , i bring to the people .
always support openly any solution good , regardless of if the proposal next the kSČM or of the ods and , the same way , i in against of the poor ideas .
ago joke when . says of ud. that is populist .
? but not what is proving with what that says ?
when . creates a plan business for the company , you also certain objectives and ideals .
and intentas acercarte to them .
will who what something populism , but all the proposals of the that i already work in the world or known experts about of them .
but , the support the parliament only you are slogans .
and with this not can survive in the policy to long long-term .
? or believes you that if . at to the people and about with them , will , for example , a responsibility criminal and financial ?
not i other option .
to to political , to journalists and to the society civil and try them of my part for this .
if outside elected president , not would problem in organise a broadcasting in direct for television in the which would to the leaders of the parties parliamentary that legitimaran the responsibility criminal and financial for political , officials , judges and tax the state .
and , eventually , them should that communicate &apos;t not what want .
if there a like strong that out the disputes , . can to pressure in the scene policy .
take for case the election direct the president , that has been a achievement of the pressure public .
the same time i that only i a amateur , not i not a out not a intellectual .
for my views and ideals attempt to allies .
just of start in the policy and attempt obtain the greater support possible for my programme .
attempt from the things forward i same , but in case of that not from well , within of six years what contribution and i the sector private .
sounds a little as if okamura outside to save the republic czech .
not i no salvador .
i that with a person not i nothing , for that i visited to a series of personalities known , for if to what better . animaran to it their candidacy the senate .
i to see to radim jančura , but . refused because had a work .
for my part , for what least i supported to the journalist of research jana lorencová , that his to the light the fraud with fruits covered of heating .
i i that of the basis of that the people is really dissatisfied , now i in the balance .
the sixty for % of the population not turned to the ballot and , those that what did , voted to the representatives the appalling .
in the senate we two the sector independent .
the people was the senate , of such way that will complicated achieve changes .
, however , i defend my own ideas , as for example the election direct of mayors or of governors .
? is recital be their own party ?
still not what i have because not i time for this , for check the last unblemished of every one of the potential member the party , not not i money .
not i money not for the campaign to the presidency , in my account transparent only there 20 billion .
? not has money ?
about of statements of the property , ? how is the their ?
clarification my property private in a 60 million .
in prague i a ground valued in 25 million , a out valued ten million , another out tasado in eight million , a now of works of art with a value of ten million , a aston martin of a 3.5 million and a škoda superb valued in a million , and in the account i a couple of million .
for true , i a aston martin because was my dream of youth . always i pleased james espionage , that seeing this car , was galante with the women and , the same time , elites against the maldades and injustices .
? leads a aston martin , their property is valued in 60 million and not has money for the campaign ?
ud. says that to change the republic but not to to too money of their part .
not is very convincing .
not i 15 million for the campaign .
? i that endeudarme ?
in the campaign already i since 2.5 million .
the fact of that not have no patrocinador shows that not there too interest in my programme .
and not i the duty of pay the campaign with money of my pocket .
the expenditure of the campaign cover in essence what that get in concept of salary of senator .
but not could live of this . for example , not could pay to my son the school english , that costs 30,000 billion month .
if i only win money , then not i would as candidate .
? so that will with their activity business for power live ?
? not has said before that was to to this activity ?
this not has nothing that see with a salary greater .
as i promised , in part i longer my activities .
for example , the representative of my agency of travel will to be my substitute in spring .
the people would that outside the samaritano that salvase the republic .
but i also need live of something .
? how advantages to win monthly as his ?
between 200 and 400 , that i gaining .
if outside president , then cease the business .

the study of architecture mVRDV shows that the real adventures not only are in the head - in the example of the library of spijkenisse and the would draw &apos; mountain of books &apos; - 2 photos
&apos; i that the building is fun , has a aspect futurista , and for end there something interesting that see &apos; , says lisette verhaig , a passer-by that is for the street .
and füle spermon , technical of it in a great company on close of the library , as : &apos; also , the building is it &apos; .
but i i wonder for what need a library today in day .
all we internet , chlorine and books electronic .
nobody will for will in these libraries past of fashionable , ? not ?
spijkenisse , a city bedroom on to the doors of suggestion that hardly deserves a fugaz visit , holds the questionable honour of have levies with a record for forget .
the population of dream inhabitants is the rate of literacy more low of the countries netherlands .
for to this situation so scandal , ago some years . decided make of any way to the culture general and imitation the seven bridges people-trafficking that officer represented in the notes of euro in way of miniaturas of concrete arm decoradas .
the success of the for amusing was limited .
and so was as the responsible political &apos;s that only there a possibility for improve the statistics : ! had that build a library !
winy maas , the study of architecture dutch mVRDV , all a proxy in the art of the diagramas of bars and responsible of buildings real-life to the couple that quai , . took the issue with their her calm and nassau to the presentation the contest in the year 2003 with five books under the it and a deficiencies in the face .
and while the jury looked visits to their around and . encogía of shoulders , maas 17,900 to up the books for size its a pyramid and brought their brief speech with the following words : &apos; ladies fellow :
here the you , my proposal for the mountain of books of spijkenisse , the so-called `Boekenberg &apos; &apos; .
nine years after , the mountain of 30 million of eur . comments in the place to .
this way part the project of revival , that . full with a parking underground , a supermarket , a office of post and a couple of buildings of housing and adosados .
to principles of november the mountain of books was medallists with the second prize &apos; &apos; library of nl 2012 &apos; .
also , the project also is nominado the &apos; dutch national wood award 2012 &apos; .
of this way , the small city sake of history , that to the date not had nothing more that offer that a area smartest posmoderna and a city incredibly flicking after whose on white one intuiría more well a central country , account now with a labour of architecture contemporary .
but on all , spijkenisse at now the first building cultural public of their history .
the long way to the book
the first impression is that . is of a paradise of books under a quesera .
well is true that there a lift that we stored fair the centre of this poisoned montañoso , but the real peace-loving the space and the reading not what use , but that prefer fundirse with their topografía to every step of their escalation to the top .
the internal completely acristalado is celebrity and easy of cover with the view , the soil of brick recocido and the elegant farolas support of way unequivocally the condition public of the library .
the environment urban is perfect .
the raise the view . can to to visualizar the banks the park , the dogs and the children and girls playing the football .
and for all both books , books and more books .
&apos; normally the shelves of books are willing to what long of the on and in the centre . opens a huge room brown-skinned that , for what general , is be something be and impersonal &apos; , says winy maas .
what that we fact us is to upside down the classical configuration space and from the area of reading the internal the foreign .
the internal of the mountain is very well tapped : in the a . are the offices , the library of internet , the club of being , the centre of education environmental and the room of peacekeeping .
is special deserve the shelves this that tries the duties of coating mural , parapeto and barandilla the same time .
the view , the you and the olfato are meet .
even the architects and the engineers civil more the day shake the head when already about of this material unknown .
&apos; we work with materials recycled &apos; , we explains joop trouborst , head the project in the city of spijkenisse .
and so is as a day , in a exploitation agricultural frisia , we brings with the by-product appropriate from of the agriculture .
since ago many years , in the greenhouses and in the camps of the countries netherlands . used a fabric plastic of scarce cable of thick as basis for sujetar the roots of the crops .
. is of a material cheap and efficient .
this fabric fine hard two stations and after . battled .
for the library this fabric . prensó , for first time in such quantities , to to printing of four centimetres of thick .
with the heat and the pressure , the so-called plastic agricultural ( kLP ) time of colour and . becomes in a material dark , harmonised and durable that of to a a of car new and zapatilla of sport .
after 105 corridor . is to the top of the mountain .
the end of this route continual of almost 500 metres around of the mountain we facing the to : since the cafeteria not only . has a fantastic view of the city , but that in she also . can enjoy of a tasty croquetas budgeting and their ficus planted in enormous pots .
these do a environment an to the couple that have the moisture air appropriate for this mountain of literature .
donations for a new soul
&apos; although costs believe this their large land as , this building is a project exemplary in what that as to the ecology &apos; , out trouborst .
the heating and the cooling necessary . are to from of energy geothermal .
to despite of that the mountain of books is on under a huge pyramid of glass , even in the days more soleados the sun only which for few hours in their internal .
the enormous cerchas of wood a in sense inter-pillar to the on of glass serve for to shadow and indicating the majority of the rays the sun .
this creates a climate internal confortable .
the rest is thing of the shutters it .
füle spermon , the scepticism worker the sector of the technologies of the information , already . has courage to to the ordinary in the new library .
and lisette verhaig also has state there .
also , the teacher of medicine traditional china her bogarde has visited the library . she described the &apos; boekenberg &apos; as the &apos; soul mention &apos; of spijkenisse .
the reason is that , with reason of the opening that had place ago a couple of weeks , . invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of their now private .
of this way . to fill , of at , the bits ópticos of a library that still not account with their archive completely ; in the today has presently copies .
the concept has sure noticed .
the shelves are teem .
&apos; not there nothing worst that a library a empty &apos; , says the architect winy maas .
&apos; i that thank to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a true link with this building .
all know that their book way part of the library .
although only is there for overturn .
of this way , the study mVRDV has managed all a success in that discipline as that in the argot specialises . known as &apos; creation of a identity &apos; .
the city of spijkenisse has writing a part of the history of the literature .
regardless of what young and inculta that can be .
for end a point of starting for shaping their identity .
szabo : &apos; the germans must play a role more leading &apos;
germany . has abstained in the vote on the admission of palestine .
according hosted szabo , expert in the relations us . uU.-Europa , this is to berlin in a position diplomatic quite business .
deutsche welle : to principles of week , germany was to understand that would in against of the proposal of give to the territories palestinians the condition of state observer of the nations un .
, however , finally berlin . abstained .
? for what ?
instigation szabo : germany not supports what that the israelis have fact in gaza .
now well , because to the relationship special that unite the country with israel , germany must have care .
but the same time i that not supports the position american .
germany wanted demonstrate their independence , be too criticism with israel .
for the embargo that had place in libya in march of 2011 , germany also . abstained when of what that . was was of establish a area of ban of flight .
this has been avowed finally for the nato .
? you is difficult to germany adopt a position clear when are in at subjects international important ?
yes , so is .
this . must to that in these at is hindrance their policy foreign , moving of a policy led , for so say , for the states united and on in a policy foreign german .
and what that difficult still more the things is that the european not have a policy coherent and uniform .
for what therefore , the germans . are in a crossroads .
of them . expected that - a role more independent , but not are used to do .
i that still are operating what will their role , but already have on the way towards a policy foreign &apos; normal &apos; .
a policy foreign similar to the countries as france or great britain .
? what means specifically a policy foreign &apos; normal &apos; since the point of view german ?
is a policy that , when . is of interests national , . shows ready to defend clash different to the of states united or their partners european .
i that the policy foreign german is a strong motivation in the policy economic , is say , in the exports and in their relations with certain regions , as can be russia , china or east next .
the interests economic germans are to true point different to the of other large powers and for that reason germany must protect their interests .
? these interests economic have affected in the position adopted with regard the conflict in east next and in the vote of the un ?
for a on , germany account with large markets in east next , especially in the gulf .
for this reason must be poppy and not alienate of the opinion public arab not not of the élite arab .
this is important , for course .
but i not you would so importance since that not . is of a relationship completely unilateral .
, however , yes play a role fundamental in the considerations german .
? has - germany their relationship with us . value the abstain of vote in important decisions as in the vote on palestine ?
i that in europe , and even in states united , the position german degree of a huge degree of understanding .
for this reason , not i that . has there a break so drastic as in the case of libya .
perhaps with this germany has achieved &apos; a true respect .
the end and the out , all this not has fact but demonstrate that is a country the that take in seriously as actor international and whose interests there that have in account .
in europe there different views about of the initiative palestine .
in change , us . value . has shown clearly to favour of a veto .
? there differences of views between us . value and many nations european ?
always have been these disparities because to the policy internal us .
i that the government of obama shows in secret a great understanding towards the position european .
but , to cause of the situation policy that . lives here , is clear that the government not can defend in public that position .
i that the real differences of views not has in reality the which that . you attaches .
if we the relations between obama and the first minister israeli netanyahu , we that obama not is for nothing happy with the policy that develops .
? you is difficult to germany reconcile the links relations that in with israel and states united , for a on , with the position of their main partners in the eu , for another ?
i that is precisely that what that ago that be so difficult for the germans .
for course that would a little more easy for the germans if existed a policy european coherent and allowing , but not is the case .
for what therefore , not have the possibility of be part of a to higher , but that must promote the things since their own position .
that is precisely what that are doing now with the euro .
i that in the future germany will a role of leadership to the time of force to europe to adopt a position european .
for course that this not is nothing easy for germany , already be simply for the relationship that in with israel .
this has been always a issue tough .
but i that the germans have clear that must play the role of on independent .
? . is germany to yes same in the role of actor international important ? ? to in reality germany in a role leading ?
? or perhaps you still underdeveloped difficult accept that leadership ?
germany still not . has have , always is something you and , for for obvious , the country you still costing play a role more important .
if we the crisis the euro , for example , we that every time that germany . an as actor main , . when certain feelings antialemanes .
this not is easy for the germans .
. is of a old problem and is that nobody to be surrounded of the countries enemies .
seen of this way , germany . is in a position a more difficult that states united .
must show a attitude inclusive with to the different neighbours and views and that not is easy .
the influence of us . value in the policy european ever every time more , but the eu not cover of at that we , ? who is then ?
to the germans not them will more no that in a role more leading .
even if not them like , if them is unpleasant or if them becomes in a people still more unpopular , c &apos; &apos;est the vie !
instigation szabo is director executive of the academy transatlantic in washington , a institution in the that academic and experts in policy from of europe and of america the north you of way joint the challenges to the that . faces the community transatlantic .
szabo is also member the polls marshall fund , where . has specialises in policy german , policy foreign us and relations transatlantic .
&apos; protection of trademark &apos; in china : when puma and armani . become of suddenly in trademark chinese
armani is a mark known to level world and side ralph lauren also .
but , ? what is watch side ?
after this name . behind a designation eu officially in china but that not has nothing that see with the companies original .
not however , this degree of protection while the real epónimos not be a demand .
and even then not is clear that . them will to to the reason .
&apos; to the foreign them is every time more difficult protect their trademark in china &apos; , out he pattloch , lawyer the bufete an wessing specialises in violations of rights of protection in extreme east .
every week is to my table a new case .
the innovators simply in a couple of you for power ! their trademark .
of this way , gucci . becomes in lu-Gucci and in place of prada . with prada-Kny .
the companies german also . copied legally of the same way , such and as you has happened the manufacturer of articles sport puma .
pattloch opens a files in the that have seats of the office of trademark of beijing .
the 14 of september of 2010 a company china which ! the mark zegna dF puma , a name artificial that also . useless of the home of fashionable ermenegildo zegna .
that the chinese are champions world in that of imitation and of all the rights of property intellectual is of too known .
in the large cities there large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting .
, however , the cases of pattloch are of other a . for charge of their customers , he fight against the fact of that the office of trademark granted of way official to the companies chinese the right to from from of a designation that already is eu in another place .
the chinese what refer &apos; bang ming pai &apos; or mark his .
the word has their origin in the term chinese &apos; bang dakuan &apos; ,
that ago reference to women that have &apos; fish &apos; to a man rico .
the authorities chinese not . feel guilty
&apos; is harmful for the business , there that fight against this &apos; , requires pattloch .
&apos; the mark ago waters , the position monopolist disappears and the damage that suffering the image is huge . &apos;
the losses financial and the as procedural of the sectors affected are millonarias , on all in the case of products flagship of luxury .
according data of the company of analysis of market cLSA , with a volume of 15 million of eur the year china is , in size , the third market of articles of luxury and the that overall to greater pace .
, however , achieve the written-off of enrolment of doubtful legality in the registration of trademark is complicated and also is a money .
the processes . can over to nine years and the result is uncertain .
pattloch about of cases in the that the court rejected a demand because had appropriations therefore time that the name subject of the demand already . had become in a &apos; reality of market &apos; .
&apos; if the they has bad fortunately , perhaps even have that pay money the plagiador because the process has damage to the mark of this in china &apos; , out pattloch .
in times this is the law of the jungle .
some of the cases more known have that see with elements graphic .
in 2009 daimler-Benz lost a he against the manufacturer of machinery of construction sany , the company that has been taken ago little for the manufacturer german of bombs of concrete putzmeister .
for that to day of today the chinese can to being a emblem very similar to the star of mercedes .
the one of corresponds , geely , his the principle a logo in white and blue that had in great measure to bmw ; the issue . dirimió in the courts and geely had that happened .
the manufacturer of clothes lacoste lost in china against imitators from of hong hong and singapore whose logo represented a crocodile eye in the direction opposite the original .
the authorities chinese not . feel guilty .
the office of trademark cTMO in beijing recognised that in 2010 have had difficulties because to the shortage of equipment and funding of personal .
the year last , , however , &apos; the situation of emergency labour the to the as &apos; .
of this way , the amount of processes of complaint , tramitar . has small in a 22 % .
almost 57.000 of these cases . worked been , a 75 % more that the year previous .
, however , 81.500 complaints are outstanding of resolution .
fight against this costs a money
as is be her in china , the figures are surprising .
the year last the cTMO registered more of 1.4 million of applications of protection of trademark , almost a third more that in 2010 .
. would of a new record and means that china lidera for tenth year running the list of new enrolment in all the world , according out the office of trademark .
seems that this also happens with the number of which valid , figure that out to 5.5 million in total .
in 2011 . would embolsado 1.8 million of cny in concept of rights .
said of other way , this means that of average every for costs 1.280 typhoon or 160 eur .
fight against this costs a money , such and as shows the case of the company family german freudenberg .
since ago more of seven years the group principal in the courts against a imitador chinese .
if well the germans have managed stop the manufacture illegal of parts of car of imitation ,
the imitador has achieved ensure the rights chinese on the mark freudenberg .
&apos; us ourselves we caused this situation because in germany the surnames not are protected &apos; , out hanno wentzler , president and consejero delegado of freudenberg chemical specialities in munich .
the office of trademark cTMO also rejected the appeal of the muniqueses .
in the two following bodies you have given the reason to freudenberg , but the part opposite still fronts in the today .
there that have great care
now the case has come to the doors the court higher of justice , where still outstanding of resolution .
wentzler responding in power resolve welcome the question and extolls the professionalism of the courts .
, however , also says that &apos; the procedure is extremely expensive , therefore in terms of money as of time &apos; .
is difficult estimate the costs internal ; the archive business has had that review dossiers of to hundred years of old for power to evidence .
ago five years freudenberg promised to the part opposite a &apos; sum of six figures in eur &apos; with the aim of to to a agreement friendly , but not had success .
&apos; this shows what a that we care &apos; , out wentzler .
the dangers that appearing in extreme east threat even with affect to europe ,
specifically if the imitators . they there the rights on trademark not protected .
so , a manufacturer chinese tried ! in germany the name freudenberg for shoes and products of fur .
ago time that the group occasion this area trade , not however in prevent the for .
&apos; there that have great care &apos; , says wentzler .
therefore he as the lawyer pattloch around to the companies german that are extremely careful to the time of to business with china .
not enough with rely in the legislation international on rights of mark , but that what that there that to is &apos; ! also in china all what that can be for of protection &apos; , such and as as wentzler .
of what contrary , the issue can be a more expensive that a simple registration .
of fact , in case of that freudenberg avoid the last assault of their battle particular , then would that pay to the part opposite rights of licence for their own name , such and as explains wentzler .
that or in the segment in question we expulsarían the market .

approximately 2 people live there , some still in simpler they of fast and foot , a great part of them are children .

esitjeni is a small example of what that affects to swaziland : the rate of infection of aids more high and the hopes of life more in of all the world , according births .
the population not is with good eyes the circumcision , a practice that according . has shown reduces to the half the risk of infection .
more the 40 % of the inhabitants of swaziland are carrying the virus of the line , and die with something more of thirty years . has become in something her .

messenger : the nasa which ice in mercury
the probe messenger has found evidence of the existence of ice in mercury .
probably the as of ice have a thick of to 20 metres .
the nasa , the agency space american , has great evidence of the existence of ice in mercury .
to despite of be the planet more have the sun , there also there water helada , such and as . from of three studies published the thursday in the magazine specialised &apos; belgian &apos; .
the probe messenger would found evidence of that in the area the planet that . is constantly to the shadow . has have a as of ice .

our window the universe : the telescopios more important
seems that the telescope was invented for hans lipperhey in 1608 , before of that galileo galilei what green a year after for it the stars .
since then , the mirrors of the telescopios ópticos not has unemployed of grow and the images that we offered have every time more depth .
for 30 years , specifically of 1947 to 1975 , the telescope hale it in the centre palomar close of st diego was the more large the world .
their mirror , in the image , had a diameter of five metres .
in coldest , us . parts . , . comments the present binocular telescope .
this allows it the manage to through of two mirrors , every one with a diameter of 8.4 metres .
the internal the great telescope canary it in the island of the palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10,4 metres .
the mirror the drawn drawn present telescope in south is segmentado for save costs .
despite to this , high a diameter of approximately eleven metres .
the these of this construction more economic is that the telescope has a angle of raising make , for what that their mobility is limited .
the telescope hobby-Eberly in alaska also has a angle of raising make .
their particularidad is their huge capacity for up light .
to despite of have with a diameter of mirror comparison more small , this capacity is taiwan to the of the telescopios of mirror more large the world .
with aid the radio of arecibo ( port puerto ) the researchers can explore the universe in search of signals of life extraterrestre .
the radio has a diameter of 305 metres .

view the centre european southern ( eSO ) it in the andean chilean .

with a total of four mirrors , this telescope also can iluminar the spectrum infrarrojo a .
the eSO also suggestions the so-called e-ELT ( european extremely present telescope or telescope european extremely large ) .
their mirror maintenance will 42 metres and will up for a total of 000 elements reflectantes .
to 2018 not . expected power take images .
to 2007 the two telescopios keck located in the volcano hawaiano of mauna kea were who the more large the world .
these have with two energy-producing , every one of them with a diameter of 10 metres .
the telescopios keck are part the centre mauna kea , that together to them explora the sky with the aid the telescope subaru and the iRTTF .
in mauna kea is to build a new telescope of enormous scale and with a diameter of mirror of thirty metres .
this is a image of how would .
, however , the information more important the manage we is of the hand the telescope space hubble .
since the 24 of april of 1990 are images of worlds distant .
since march of 2009 the telescope space kepler search planets extrasolares , mainly those that are liveable .
the 2 of february of 2011 the nasa announced that since the beginning of their mission . had localised 1.235 candidates to planets .
in the image . are the last preparations very the launching the telescope space kepler .
the telescope james webb space telescope ( jWST ) not . launched the space to board of a lift-off ariane 5 to 2018 .
the mirror primary of this telescope space has a diameter of 6.5 metres .
a of the duties of this telescope will to the light of the first stars and wars charity after the bang bang .
the researchers proceed of the basis of that in the side southern of mercury also there ice .
, however , not there evidence tenable , since that the probe messenger this in about the planet in a from a more their the side north .
since ago decades the measurements of radar invite to the existence of ice in mercury .
thank to the probe messenger ( 2004 ) , the first that contradict in about to mercury , now the scientists have the certainty of that is so .

a for of fingerprinting in a country in the that the people of 97 years still are considered young .
the way for the region mountainous of talysh could plain of with and romantic .
the minibús is with great suspect to through of the sinuosa road that is the on of hill boscosas , rivers of great wealth and of the simpler houses of the farmers local .
all is green and juicy , one could even think that . is in the jungle black .
, however , we we in the area more south of azerbaijan ; since here the border with iran . is to so only a kilometres .
here live the &apos; talyshi &apos; , a people the that not . know a , from of that dominated perfectly the persian and the azerí and that are very stalk .
our destination end is lerik .
this small city defeating of a architecture perhaps too maciza sewn in the was soviet and that not seems dovetailed the all in a landscape montañoso so attitudes .
the tourists european hardly they to this place , already that the way since the capital of azerbaijan , baku , is too heavy .
for go the 323 kilometres that separate both numbers urban , . need eight hours because the road is of a only sense .
the astonishing wealth of the that degree the country thank the oil the sea caspian still not has come to this recóndita region .
, however , pilata fatulayeva ( 48 ) is convinced of that lerik has what that there that have for become in a tourist tourist .
&apos; baku . was famous in may with reason of the since the festival of song and the next year we the festival of the people more elderly the world &apos; , out fatulayeva .
. is of the director the museum of the longevity , perhaps the only that there in the world .
here is detailed the life of eight dozens of talyshis the place that have have the 100 years of age . fatulayeva out a image in white and black .
this is my grandfather , that lived 120 years .
a son own died to the age of on years
, however , the star an the museum is the herding of sheep şirali müslümov , that seems have through 168 years .
not however , not there no starting of birth that what certifique .
and if we in account that the man of greater age detailed lived with years , seems that the age of müslümov is quite suspect .
&apos; born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973 &apos; , we explains fatulayeva .
the man was includes in three times and had 23 children . the appear still had time of conceive a daughter more to the age of on years .
? . has wrong then şirali müslümov in their age in a couple of decades ?
, however , rembrandt scholz , gerontólogo in the institute charisma planck of rostock , also has heard about of the elderly age of this head of asia central .
&apos; in some regions of china , japan or in the valley of hunza in pakistan also live people of age very elderly &apos; , says scholz , &apos; even in sardinia there many men elderly &apos; .
because to the lack of documents , is impossible to evidence scientific about of the age ; very when not there no registration civil .
all the days vasos in of butter derretida
is a fact that , of way surprisingly often , the inhabitants of the region on in about to lerik usually achieve a age biblical .
in the today there 20 people that campaigning the 100 years of age .
? for what live here , in the southern , many people of age elderly ?
the guide purposes azerí farid mugimzadeh explains that . is of the genes special of the talyshis .
the director the museum , the mrs fatulayeva , believes in change that the cause lies in the food .
, however , since a point of view nutritional , not seems logical that precisely the food rich in lowcalorie of the talyshi , that adoran the meat , the bread and on all the products dairy and many of the which , also , they daily a glass of butter derretida , be so healthy .
? or perhaps be the way of life natural the that in to the people young ? in cengemiran , a small settlement not far of the city of lerik lives rubaba mirzayeva .
to their 97 years is relatively young for what that . estila for these latitudes .
mirzayeva , that says have 143 descendants , lives in a simple home of wood typical of all the region the caucasus .
ages in the soil , all of way unstinting a huge tina of butter .
eight people live under a homeless , between them one of the children and a daughter of mirzayeva , both . became in grandparents ago time .
also brincan of a on to another two children small .
in the kitchen prepare tea for the invited , a tea that serve in a vasos classic with way abombada .
the european of mirzayeva are white and are perfectly premises and under the wearing behind two we trenzas of hair who dark that their son we which proud .
always i i laundering the hair with milk , for that never . i has fallen and has had their colour .
&apos; not i used never a cosmetic &apos; , says mirzayeva .
the pension is enough for live
of always has – only what that was in their own farm : tomatoes , potatoes and peas .
in all my life not i gone never to to the buying to a supermarket .
then we about of their husband , that was in the army .
what worst was the time of to the second war world .
, however , all the to their put when the &apos; wanted father &apos; , heydar aliyew , took the control of the situation .
this kind of propaganda sounds rare in their of a woman greater .
, however , in azerbaijan the seems that . pursuing to the on colorado of the nation , that at their country as a dictator , not known limits .
this . remained in the power to 2003 , at in the that gave the witnessed to their son ilham .
the least the people elderly of azerbaijan not know what that is the poverty .
mirzayeva price cederschiöld manat ( approximately the same amount in eur ) in concept of pension monthly , a amount with the that . can live well taking in account the situation here .
and perhaps the canoso son of mirzayeva have reason : &apos; in our culture the elderly are very respected &apos; .
live in a great family , are amados , receive all the care necessary and are happy .
as if this not outside reason enough for in with life many years ...
in the constitution lack the expression &apos; rights human &apos;
the revolution has their the cairo .
demonstrations that vying between yes in the cairo are of clear the exaggerated division in the that is desperately the country .
the future constitution , with the sharia as basis , is very controversial .
the president egyptian not indulge in eschew .
&apos; we overcome the transition .
and that that happen is my responsibility , to the people and to god &apos; , said in the television public .
their speech was at to all the people , on all to the coptic christians , the liberals , the muslims go and the secular .
all them , ragamuffin , no to now in a confused opposition , have fear .
fear of a theocracy to on the kordofan for the grace of the powerful community muslim .
such and as explains mohammed mursi , almost asking forgiveness , has had that official of way temporary the powers the court constitutional and expanding the you &apos; for power save the revolution &apos; .
, however , not the egyptians not the world whole know very well what that this engineering of 61 years with a title of phd orientates for the university the southern of california to save really .
? to deprived of their power to the judiciary ?
of fact , the 234 articles , whose adoption has been forced for a house assembly an for 100 member overwhelmingly islamists in a meeting quality of 15 hours of long-term , are truly worrying .
as in previous constitutions , in the draft also . says that the justice . on in the &apos; principles the right islamic &apos; .
, however , ? what means that of &apos; principles &apos; ?
this was and still be open to the interpretation and seems that the islamists will to take this vague wording , so as the for of manoeuvre legal that has thereby , for impose a interpretation more strict of the sharia .
this is the least what that suggests a new article added : in all the issues relating to the sharia is compulsory put to the university al-Ashar , the institution islamic more important the country with a great power in all the an sunni .
not has for what be so , but this can mean that the clergy monitored the legislation , something that - of fact - would as result the ’ of the judiciary .
great part the draft of the constitution is open to the interpretation
what that also is problem is that to keep the jurisdiction military .
for the dictatorship of mubarak these courts which for as a hard repression on the opposition .
after the with the dictator to 11 civil . who detained in prisons military .
such and as for the draft , the state has of protect &apos; the real essence of the family egyptian &apos; and &apos; promote their moral and their values &apos; .
. is of a wording so imprecise in terms legal that with the aid of this article the institutions state could even control the content of the offsetting and the literature .
about clear not . is of other thing that of censure .
for true that no article for of way explicitly the equal between men and women .
in change another prohibits offend or punished the prophet mohammed and to their travelling .
, however , not is clear what is a &apos;s and how has of be sanctioned .
as of doubtful is the wording that prohibits the &apos; &apos;s to the people &apos;
? is enough a caricature the president or a joke on a letrado ?
question of interpretation , as many other things in the draft that has been presented to mursi for their signing and that according , their words , &apos; very soon &apos; will presented to the egyptians for be subject to referendum .
&apos; the revolution has again &apos;
ago weeks that the opposition is closing discussed with to the superiority of the islamists .
ten billion people . met in a unusual harmony in the later the friday in the square tahrir the cario and juraron to fail the minutes before of that can into in force .
&apos; the revolution has their and end defeating &apos; , says hamdin sabbahi , that taken the third place in the lists to the elections presidential .
the nobel of the peace and exdirector the body international of energy atomic , mohamed el-Baradei , declared that the draft of the constitution should be &apos; in the dustbin of the waste of the history &apos; .
to through of twitter was to the followers of mursi of to lead a &apos; coup of state against the democracy &apos; .
&apos; when called the referendum reflect to their de and what derrocaremos &apos; , says the opponent jasser akbar .
&apos; still not we tired , the blood of our brothers still not has been expiada &apos; , . from in the media egyptians the political rosales chaled ali .
and several judges announced that not wanted monitor the referendum , for what that not . considered valid .
&apos; the koran is our constitution &apos;
for their part , the community muslim well organised was a call for so a contramanifestación ; for if are not in the square tahrir , but after a sentence the another on the disputed , to the university of the cairo .
many women covered with a entering and supporters of the salafistas were part in the same the out of : &apos; the people requires the implementation of the law god-given &apos; .
demanded to mursi &apos; must the country &apos; , the same time that proclamaban : &apos; the koran is our constitution &apos; .
a fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic square tahrir , where started all , would caused a situation similar to the of a war civil .
is clear that the supporters of mursi not wanted avail to that something so and .
the brothers muslims said that therefore the that . who the draft of the constitution as the supporters the same would expressed their views high and clear .
now would come the at of to that the people bore in the ballot what direction should to the country .
in this sense , seems that the draft of the islamists has transaction the majority .
&apos; the expression &apos; rights human &apos; not even is &apos;
were abu saeda is blokland with this process constitutional forced that in reality should have disburse to february and have including to all the forces social .
this lawyer of 48 years specialises in rights human and president of the organisation egyptian of rights human ( eOHR ) for to the brothers muslims when . who by in prison or had that to with to a trial for the dictatorship of mubarak .
not because compartiera their ideology , but because for he the rights human are indivisible .
for this reason was beat , condemned and imprisoned .
&apos; and now the expression `Derechos human &apos; not even is in the new constitution &apos; , . regrets in a conversation with the newspaper &apos; welt am am &apos; .
the enlargement of the powers of mursi to the three powers the state was that this lawyer . resign .
the measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules the at democratic and will to egypt to a new dictatorship .
&apos; in place of strengthen the society civil , what that has fact the president is abolirla &apos; , . regrets saeda .
, however , the democracy not can work , the organisations of the society civil .
saeda . feel abandoned , also for the community international , the which is the fight ideological that is taking place to on the nuba with a a of curious and tension .
this could their in their against .
a manifestante in the square tahrir on : &apos; you concibiendo a monster that not podréis control &apos; .
the rakfisk norwegian : ? the fish more stale the world ?
the five million of inhabitants of norway enjoy of one of the elderly levels of life , not only of europe but the world .
? is possible that the success the country besides any relationship with their eagerly for a fish extremely passing ?
should a series of fruits unduly curados .
colóquelos in a of a mountain of clothes of football amount and húmeda .
déjelo there a week .
will then nostrils the sluggish smell the rakfisk , a of the exquisiteces of norway .
i i in the small city of fagernes , to a three hours of oslo .
is snowed . the landscape is witnessed and that smell , always present , fleet in the air .
the rakfisk is trucha in fortify that . is fermentar in water for , on of what stale that you what one , to a year .
to measure that oscurece and is doing more cold , the no who in at to a festival that . is here , in fagernes , into to this manjar of what more , for so say , cautivador .
&apos; . oil and then . &apos; a glass of moonshine of a bitter &apos; , says havard halvarsen , fire-fighter of the city that is also what that . known as the &apos; general the rakfisk &apos; , that . for of organise the festival .
for all both we people eating this fish that . have in small buckets and wearing of a bitter important quantities of the drink .
&apos; to some people them like more the whisky that the rakfisk &apos; , says havard .
the drink can kill the smell .
pruebo some front .
if you avoid overlook close of the nose , not is wrong ; not is very different to a unitary of them that has way a few kilometres in bus .
the rakfisk is a product that from of a time very different , in the that the poverty azotaba norway and in the that , before of that existed the cooling , the fish . deleted for the autumn undeclared in water and salt in barrels herméticos .
more later , in plenary winter , when already is well fermented , . out and , obviously with the ways people because the alcohol , . eaten .
ago so only a generation , thousands of no . were forced to leave their country in search of work , and emigrated mainly to states united .
currently , the population is increasing quickly ; more the 13 % are immigrants , attracted for the abundance of jobs of work , high wages and a completely system of services social .
a aware of inhabitants of sweden , the old contravention and to ago not too a more rich that norway , is to this country for work .
the rakfisk . as something important , a part essential , although quite chauvinism , the last of norway .
. is between the dishes more expensive that . can buy .
but , of fact , all is expensive . a cane of beer or a crush you cost the admired of 10 € ( $ 14 ) every one .
norway not is by in the order the day of the news international and to the majority of no them like that so be .
here the people still is little ready to pronounce the name of anders breivik , the racist of extreme right that acribilló to shot and killed to 77 people , between the that had men , women and children .
in their place , . are the pursuit as &apos; the basin the 22 of july &apos; .
to the no them costs great believe that in their mild country one of the their outside capable of commit such cruelty and murder .
after very of the wealth current of norway . is the growth , since principles of the 70 , of a of the industries of oil and of gas more large the world .
&apos; but the oil not is the only reason for the that we is so well &apos; , says anna , our camarera , while is happening on-board of rakfisk and that , with their long melena rubia and their surprising eyes blue , represents the image the welfare norwegian .
&apos; we , as you you.&apos; , people it &apos; .
their english , as the of the majority of people in this country , is whiter .
&apos; not we like as , not we like the there &apos; .
norway has managed their wealth oil with very caution ; all , are a small percentage the money from of this industry , . invested in a fund special in benefit of the future generations .
while all the world malgastaba money that not had for the years that preceded to the crisis financial in all the world , norway remained the our well closed .
&apos; while we keen in winter and to senderismo in summer , we pleased &apos; , says anna .
&apos; and feed rakfisk &apos; , adds with a casual carcajada .
i in the snow doing eu for feed something ; already i had enough rakfisk .
now a hamburger of strongest is , doubt something different and quite suculento that saborear .
but for the night , again that classic fish .
the hotel in the that i alojo is one of the many local in the that . is a dinner of rakfisk in the that the diners vote the better fish , or perhaps the that more being to test the hidden nasales .
a television has logged in direct with a presentador that has pajarita and that is surrounded of dishes of rakfisk .
seems the contest of song .
&apos; ? what are release points for the better fish there down in the mountains , thor-Juergen ? &apos;
&apos; here is our puntuación , havard . &apos;
there laughter and applause .
a man . you of the wheelchair , perhaps beat for the whisky .
or perhaps are the vapour of all that fish .
mexico : eight peña grandson . faces to a hard beginning
while the president incoming of mexico , casas peña grandson , . for for take possession of their office , the correspondent of the bbc , will directed , analysing the challenges to the that . facing the new president and the different expectations of their population .
the traffic in city of mexico is especially bad currently .
in a city that , in the best circumstances , already is of for yes congestionada , . has installed since the monday a counter of steel that shorter several of the roads main that have to the city and that is causing a chaos huge in the roads .
the aim , not however , not was prevent that the workers so to to their place of work , but avoid that the demonstrators so to the parliament .
the saturday , the new president of mexico , widow peña grandson , will the bandwidth presidential and will the management of the nation .
. faces to a task one .
mexico has gone moving good results economic for the government outgoing of felipe calderón , but the country . is undeclared in a war against the narcotráfco that . has claimed already a at lives in six years .
&apos; my government has the great compromise with the people mexican of reduce the violence &apos; , he the mr peña grandson to principles of this week the president of states united , barack obama , in the clearance shenanigans .
&apos; i to propose a new strategy of security that we will achieve that aim &apos; .
before of codearse with the president of the us , the experience policy prior the mr peña was as governor of their state home , the of mexico .
a state very populated and with a quickly growth , that are the capital ; the views on the new leader are divided in this territory in the that he held ! .
a man honest
in the bucólica city of valley the bravo , for example , . you reminds with will .
their residents you some the merit the growth the tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructure .
for to to the city . can drive for a of the new roads the mr peña grandson , what that is a huge improvement compared with the roads agrietadas and vaults of bumpy that were rehabilitadas .
also . can see rachinel with their name in the entry of a modern polideportivo and of a impressive museum exponential on the change climate .
&apos; we in that he successful to a change real and lasting &apos; , says their friend and ally political mor olvera springs , member the party the mr peña grandson , the pRI .
&apos; particularly , in what that . as to security and economy , we the interesting and real change that our country therefore needs &apos; .
after a period uninterrupted of 81 years in the power , the pRI was desbancado for vicente fox in the year 2000 .
the member olvera accepts that , after 12 years outside the de presidential of the pinos , within the party there many expectations regard to youngest peña grandson .
this also the rating that the opposition ago of lack of essence the new president .
&apos; is a man very honest , very committed and with a excellent vision the country .
is a fantastic man of state and , for above of all , is a person that know listen . &apos;
, however , the another on the state that not is the impression that has very people on their former governor .
in nezahualcoyotl , known also as city neza , the contrast with the streets adoquinadas of valley the bravo not could be greater .
escondida under stretches of appears high is , in many ways , a suburb of the own city of mexico .
and the problems the municipality are also hard and urban .

my crisis of identity mexicano-estadounidense
says that many . were forced to leave mexico because to the lack of opportunities
the mexican tend to criticise to the that . were ; says that reminiscent to the mexican of those times difficult
navarrette observing that the mexicano-estadounidenses . are trapped between two worlds .
in a recent journey to city of mexico , hardly had down for the on and come to the area of has of immigration and already was completely confused .
a notices did the way towards two on : a for &apos; mexican &apos; and other for &apos; foreign &apos; .
i was there a seconds , be sure towards where should go .
the have grown in california central , for all my life i have called &apos; mexican &apos; .
. is of taquigrafía ethnic , the same way in that my friends of boston . are to yes ourselves as &apos; irish &apos; or my friends of new york . as to yes ourselves &apos; italian &apos; .
more later i decided for &apos; mexicano-estadounidense &apos; .
but this was mexico .
and , in the homeland of my grandfather , the taquigrafía or the paragraphs not were necessary .
simply was us .
i spanish . what enough well as for manejarme for a interview in this language .
but not i the level of vocabulary of a nativo and not i deshacerme of my accent american .
so that i my passport us and i i in the eu of foreign .
i in at at of this week in the that the president elected of mexico , casas peña grandson , visited the home white for meet with the president obama .
in the agenda the day , as always that . meet the leaders of these two countries , withdrew : immigration , drugs and trade .
peña grandson was look about also the growth of the economy mexican , a of the reasons for the that in these at is so likely that a mexican . be in mexico as that . unwanted to go to the states united .
to partner with states united and canada and create in america a bloc trade the lifestyle of the union european .
also , peña grandson promised to fighting against the which of the drugs in mexico , although not was details .
for mexico , the relationship with the states united is one and is full of grudge .
probably the majority of americans never . remember of that in 1848 the states united invaded mexico and his to their leaders to yield the half of their territory to is of at .
but for the mexican , that think in centuries , not in minutes , the elements that . what reminiscent are for all parties .
so that , in the at in the that a official of the states united says any thing that such the more minimum criticism to mexico , empiezas to hear complaints , therefore in the press as between the elite mexican , on how the americans are usurpando the sovereignty of their neighbours .
and the children of moctezuma . are in ordinary of war .
and still so , for mexico , the relationship that really is all a challenge is the that have with the more of 35 million of mexicano-estadounidenses that live in the states united .
? we of grudge ?
there a .
in mexico there winners and losers , people for the that the country provided opportunities and other for the that not is so .
the only reason for the that there many people of hungarians mexican living in cities as the angels , the vegas , as , denver or st for is that , in some point of our tree genealógico , there a person , can that the father or the mother or one of the grandparents , to the that . you closed the door of the opportunities in mexico and had that leave towards the north .
and the majority of the sometimes that person fit in a profile particular : fur brown-skinned , a level of studies under , from of a people poor , etc
us we their top-down and them we loyal .
to mexico not .
and , to despite of that perhaps we living now the dream american , the have gone to good schools and have had good jobs , not we lose never of view that what that we living is that , the dream american , and not the mexican .
is possible that to sometimes our identity not is clear , but our loyalty yes that what is .
is for the states united .
also , we aware of that to many of the mexican lot to the elite of the class leader not them gustamos .
the sense is mutual .
we are as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and we who for above the shoulders as if about of a category than that not is what enough mexican .
our spanish never will what enough good and our links with mexico never will what enough strong .
to their way of see , our existence is synonymous of failure .
if our families not would failed in mexico , not . would gone .
and now not we be trapped after this curtain of wool , living well in the states united but , still so , as souls solitarias .
my woman , that born in guadalajara and wine legally to the states united when was a girl , i reminds that there this roce between the mexican and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know with more strength who are and to the seconds this them bother .
although is citizens of the states united , she . as part of the two countries .
while therefore , many mexicano-estadounidenses that know feel that not are part of none of the two .
we love listen the group mexican the tigers the north , but also to bruce springsteen .
you what better of every country , but not you deep-rooted to none of them .
in mexico we are as americans .
and in the states united . we as mexican .
now , for more still more the things , for what that i i have for my journey , some leaders mexican and some intellectuals want again to connecting with the diaspora .
want that the mexicano-estadounidenses work as &apos; ambassadors &apos; of mexico makeshift , been their interests in the states united .
diríamos to our colleagues americans what fantastic that is visiting that country and presionaríamos to the leaders political for that reforzaran their links with mexico .
yes , clear ...
that not is to to .
there too grudge .
and , with the inequality of wages , the corruption rampant and the violence for drugs , many of us not we so insurance of that be a country fantastic .
i fear that you sötét to be alone with this idea , friends .
is fair .
if some mexican still not are prepared for pardon to the states united for the way in the that were to mexico ago a century and a , then have that accept the fact of that some mexicano-estadounidenses still are raise for how . was to their family ago great least time .
hmmm .
perhaps us more &apos; mexican &apos; of what that i .
this battles , new east a
the high the ceasefire between israel and hamas well could be a basis little likely for the peace
? will have some day a peace lasting between arab and jews in east a ?
another bloodletting of blood that seems indicate that any hope is in vain .
in a of the so and arise further on who began first , countless of buildings have been lower to rubble ; more of 140 palestinians , the majority of them civil , and six israelis have been killed and , for first time , rockets from of gaza have fallen close of aviv aviv , the fixed of israel , and the city holy of jerusalem .
but , to despite of that the israelis and the palestinians seem be community-based in their former conflict , all as them are in east a is changing .
the spring arab what has longer all fact dirty them like or not , palestinians and israelis have been trapped in the mighty regional .
perhaps this do that their fight be still more bloody that before .
, however , there reasons for think that their lethal situation of point died could desencallarse .
a war that not . lose not . earns
to first view , the optimism seems currently very difficult of justify .
even if . in the high the ceasefire agreed the 21 of november , the clashes of this week have reinforced to the hawks of both sides .
the leaders of hamas , the movement islamist that has centre gaza since 2007 , have have forced to the israelis to from , to despite of that gaza has received a good him .
and to despite of have killed to some of their leaders and trouble to pressure to the 1.7 million of inhabitants of gaza in one of the they more squalid and populated the planet , israel not has been end with hamas .
of fact , hamas is gaining ground in west , the other part of palestine currently ruled for their implacable rival of fatah , the facción palestine more moderate .
also , the leaders of hamas could to to the conclusion of that the time is to their favour .
given that the islamists have gone gaining influence for all the world arab , hamas has fact amistades richest and powerful .
turkey , a renaciente power regional that before had been the ally muslim more have to israel , has espoused the cause of hamas . also what has fact qatar , one of the states more rich and dynamic the gulf .
the exultantes member of hamas say that the average moon islamist is saluting israel , since the lebanon the north , where dominates the partido-milicia hizbulá , happening for syria , where the rebels of a trend every time more islamist could bring to bashar by , to to to jordan , where the allies of hamas are threatening the king .
on all in the with south of israel , the growth of the brothers muslims targeted for the president muhammad morsi in egypt , with difference the more populated and fundamental of the countries arab , has changed the balance of the region .
hosni mubarak , the déspota quarters that period in egypt for 30 years to their fall in 2011 , not had too time for hamas .
in change , the brothers muslims are - brothers of hamas and their leaders on more of the opinion popular .
in future actions diplomatic , is possible that hamas 1.7 as leading the that not . can from , not even israel and the states united .
while therefore , the arrived hard of israel sorry the conclusion opposite .
in what that . as the question military , have since to hamas in their website .
the system antiballistic cúpula of iron of israel has shown their effectively and many of the rockets of hamas have been destroyed .
the israelis dormirán more so ... for some time .
in as to the diplomacy , states united . shows more firm that never ; many countries european also culparon to hamas of have on the last wave of violence .
to all , israel has been . especially under the government of benjamin netanyahu , a first minister that has ignored widely the process of peace .
although the rockets fired since gaza have over with the life of a 30 israelis since 2004 , israel not has had many terrorists suicide , in part thank to the barrier that corroe west , the main part of a territory aspiring to become in state of palestine , and it the settlements jews that are increasing to despite of that , according the legislation international , are illegal .
the mr netanyahu , whose party fighters . has uk to a group of a line still more hard by for avigdor lieberman in the period run-up to the elections the 22 of january , is in a good position .
? for what mimar to these retorcidos palestinians dándoles a state own ?
if really gobernaran in west , ? not dispararían rockets such and as have fact their compatriots in gaza ?
is better they after that wall and them a good coup if rose the head .
perhaps . will the arrived hard , although the spring arab could tamper their are .
although the islamists that take the power in egypt and in other websites not have too hold to israel , their priority will address the difficulties internal .
the budget of defence of israel is greater that the of their four neighbours arab together .
an a war with the superpower of the area hardly will to the new governments arab to improve their economies .
that the pragmatism mr morsi has worked with barack obama for to the high the ceasefire is a good well and could drive the beginning of something .
also the israelis should think to long long-term .
with the rest the world arab inventive more democratic , deprived to the palestinians of their right to the self-determination is create a volcano that a day explotará in the territories occupied for israel , of the same way that this week technologists a bus in tel aviv .
the repression already is destroying the democracy in the state jewish and the demography worse the situation to measure that is the population arab .
the cruentas missions against gaza every two or three years for reject to hamas they a toll diplomatic every time greater .
both sides need a right of people which the conflict .
the solution still being the that pregonan people sensible of both sides , the majority the world foreign and this newspaper : two states and the bid of territory for part of israel for reasons of security .
the hope , small to short long-term , is that the high the ceasefire given a little more of momentum to the people which that are fighting for this cause .
egypt , that must start to to curb to the entry of weapons in gaza , together with turkey and qatar , . is in a situation , unprecedented for to to hamas of that accept the idea of a state jewish based in the borders of 1967 , with exchanges of land and a jerusalem shared .
the arab outsiders the issue also should on to hamas and fatah for that . join .
that help more to the creation of a state palestinian that the spelling attempt of obtain a category of state virtual in the un .
the mr obama also has a important role in what that as to to to to israel to the table of negotiating .
for their first mandate omitió it their own plan for the peace .
of new in the home white , seems as of reluctant to unique their attention .
this attitude is a blot vision of future .
a east a stable is of vital interest for the states united .
this means a agreement of peace between israel and palestine .
the law of packaged generic of tobacco will in force in australia
warnings on the risks of smoking and parties the body with diseases lucen on packets of a microphone colour green , that are the same for all the trademark of tobacco
the law – in on of tobacco and rapid generic , europe in the world , will in force and replacing the which and the colours of the trademark for a fobbed of a microphone green olive , a appalling images of parties the body with diseases and &apos; of children and babies people for be children of parents smokers .
to exception of the various images and warnings health , the only difference between the packets , can since the saturday , are the names of the trademark , all them &apos;s in a kind of source small .
. is the regime more narrower the world applied the rapid of tobacco .
the government federal of australia says that the aim is could to the young of smoking by the elimination of the broad that do that this kick have glamour .
responding in studies that shown that if a person not has started to smoking before of the 26 years , there a 99 % of for of that never what do .
&apos; . can see that the children , even since very early age , understand the message that the company tobacco is trying sell to through of their mark &apos; , said the minister of health federal , tanya plibersek , quote studies that aggressive , for example , how the girls relacionaban the logo of a contain with the idea of be a princess .
to despite of that australia account with a of the rates of smokers more in the world and that these changes not will too to the profits of the multinationals , other countries are recital take measures similar .
the industry tobacco has that a pressure huge in against of the law .
the companies cigarette said that the law promote the market black of tobacco , in the that the cigarette would more cheaper and more accessible .
&apos; the legislation comply serious consequences do &apos; , said ayr mcIntyre , of the british american tobacco , in australia .
will the amount of tobacco that bring the contravenes of china and indonesia for marketplace in the streets of australia .
other people say that their business . has benefited after the adoption of the law .
sandra has , of zico import pty co , a small company family , said that the demand of pitilleras and covered of silicone for loopholes the unpleasant images of the packets . had bells almost since zero ago two months , when the british american tobacco , britain &apos; &apos;s imperial tobacco , philip morris and also tobacco lost a weakening to the law in the court supreme of australia .
the mrs has said that zico had sold to 6 units to establishments trades and that was waiting more stocks .
&apos; for us is a good business &apos; .
according the experts , the possible obstacle is the popularity of the networks social between the sector demographic the that . at the plan .
after a series of laws collecting that prohibit the advertising in the television and the sponsorship of sports and that on to the majority of sellers to not to the cigarette to the view , the marketing the tobacco has last to take in line .
australia has ban the advertising in internet to companies and pages website local , but not can fan in pages foreign .
&apos; if comercializas tobacco and so only you is this small window for twenty-first your products , the space in line is the place more convincing in the that be &apos; , said becky freeman , it of health public of the university of sydney .
freeman observed a increase of packet on trademark from of &apos; citizens of to ordinary &apos; premises in pages website of networks social as youtube , twitter and facebook .
is ask if . is so only of a citizen private to who really you crazy the cigarettes marlboro and . has taken the trouble of to a video or if any company of marketing is behind of all this .
the british american tobacco of australia pressed that the industry . on more in what that means the regulation new that in the marketing .
the industry has come even to pay for that ukraine , honduras and the republic dominican recusen the new rules ; these countries are saying to the organisation world the trade that . is restrictive the trade unfairly , to despite of that none of these countries has a volume of trade significant with australia .
is likely that the wto dictate a resolution to in of 2013 .
plibersek said that the government had had discussions with other countries that are recital apply laws similar in on of packaged of tobacco .
in the year 2001 canada . became in the first country that introduced the mandatory of include images in the packets .
currently are can in more of 40 countries , between the that . are brazil , turkey and ukraine .
in great britain , new zealand , south and india . is recital apply laws more tough .
in australia many smokers . show harsh .
&apos; the photographs not i affect .
simply not them i case &apos; .
&apos; coges the cigarro and guards the package &apos; , says jesuit the hage while buying a package with the image of a by in the their .
&apos; sincerely , only there a reason for the that cease of smoking : for my daughter . &apos;
james yu , managing the estanco king of the pack in the centre of sydney , points that the packets uniform do that you it more complicated getting in the shelves .
&apos; normally irregularities a time in desenvalar a over ; now tardo four &apos; , says yu .
&apos; the government should have ban completely the tobacco and then , already is , is , . over and on the shop &apos; , says while comments the hands towards down .
in a world constantly provider , not is so wrong europa a little
for the testing the day of action of thank of this year , of way unexpectedly i that to five hours in a airport because the air in the that volábamos suffered a problem electronics and had that wait to that would another air .
so that i great time for think in the platitude .
not you i to lie .
pasarse a day in a airport waiting to that it a flight is quite boring , even if you media for be &apos; , as books , weeklies or iPhones , , ignore of the shops critical .
but every time there more academic and experts in development child that praising the blessings the platitude .
according them , is well that , therefore us as our children , we aburramos of time in when .
dull forced the which to to options interesting and can that encourage the creativity .
given that , currently , the majority of us we connected to this or to that screen , not we the profits that provided the platitude .
so that , ? should accept of good mind the platitude ?
yes .
and not .
but , already we of this more forward .
in first place , the as that very people , supposed that , now that we of more time for the leisure , the platitude would a phenomenon relatively recent .
but , such and as says peter toohey , professor of history greek and roman of the university of calgary , in canada , and author the book &apos; boredom : to lively history &apos; ( &apos; the platitude , a history encouraged &apos; ) published in 2011 for yale university reporter , not is so .
&apos; of fact , the history the platitude is very can &apos; , says .
in the walls of pompeya there graffitis in latin on the platitude that dating the century i 9th
also we ourselves how define the platitude .
&apos; the problem is that already . has defined and discussed of very various ways &apos; , points john am eastwood , professor of psicología of the university of york in ontario , canada .
after at the research premises and raise the idea to a group of discussion have for 100 people , the professor eastwood and their colleagues defined the platitude as the experience of &apos; desired , but not power , participate in a activity that you full &apos; .
says that the difference between the platitude and the indian is that the person not ago something but to do .
out that with the apathy not there the i of to something .
the experience main the platitude , says , is &apos; the at the process of attention , associated to a under state of mind and to a that of that the time is slowly &apos; .
the platitude can sound painfully &apos; to the depression .
, however , the professor eastwood says that , although they be related , the people that are tedious tend to see the problem as a question the environment or the world , while that the people that are exceptions they that the problem what have them .
to sometimes we that we boring , when what that we is in reality is that we problems for our .
in their study &apos; the unengaged mind : defining boredom in terms of attention &apos; , published in the edition of september of the magazine perspectives as psychological meat , the professor eastwood and their colleagues . were to a experiment previous in the that the participants escuchaban a cut of a person that surplus the article of a magazine .
some groups heed in the room neighbouring a programme of television to all volume that not deleted no relationship , other what heed with the volume under , of way that hardly was noticeable , while that the third group not listened the audio in no at .
the group that listened the programme with the volume under was more platitude that the other two groups ; them cost focus , but not were insurance of for what and what atribuyeron the platitude .
&apos; when intentas concentrarte in a task difficult or interesting , the at of the attention can to the platitude &apos; , pressed mark donnelly fenske , professor of neurociencia of the university of guelph , in ontario , and one of the authors the study .
&apos; for another on , when you doing something boring , as detect parts changing in a line of manufacture , a music that you distraiga you can help to not aburrirte &apos; .
&apos; of fact , currently we that ! or to garabatos , actions that to often . are as sign of platitude , can in reality help to combat , already that do that that person is physically more warning &apos; .
&apos; the research shown that those children to the that . them allows ! about more and observation more information that those to the that . them forced to be static &apos; , says the professor fenske .
all we what that is europa in some at : the delay of a air , a speaker spin , a film especially dismally .
but some people have more trend to europa that other .
for help to medirlo , some researchers proceeded in the years 80 a &apos; at of trend the platitude &apos; .
the at includes issues as &apos; many of the things that i that to are repetitive and monótonas &apos; and &apos; there many things that i interested that not i time of do all &apos; .
stephen vodanovich , professor of psicología of the university of west florida , says that , being these chords , the researchers have discovered that the boys have more trend to dull more to often that the girls , and specifically need more stipulation external and more diverse .
but , in general , the adolescents are a kind of group that . boring with quite easily .
in 1991 , reed larson , professor of development human and community of the university of illinois , was to out a experiment in the that . were in contact with 400 adolescents and with their parents between seven and eight sometimes the day by a search .
found that the 32 for % of the adolescents said that . aburría while was in the school or doing the duties , while that the 23 for % said that . aburría when not was in the school .
for another on , the 3 for % of the parents were that . aburrían .
the professor larson said that not was if the rates of platitude current , 21 years after , would with or lower .
but said that what that yes was was that &apos; the adolescence is a period in the that the platitude high their correctness more high &apos; , in great part because to that therefore to the children as to the adolescents not . them it a great control on what that want to .
so that , back to my question the principle : ? is good europa ?
to sometimes not what is , already that , taken the extreme , can to that we negligence to risks physical absurd , as to betting or we in the consumption of substances as method for combat , such and as shown the research .
for another on , many scholarship and writers about of the connection between the platitude and the creativity , according says the professor vodanovich , that has state at this question for more of two decades .
&apos; the platitude is the way that has the which of advice that we be doing other thing &apos; , says fringes marcus , professor of psicología of the university of new york .
but the which not always know what is what more appropriate .
if you boring and you that energy for play the guitarra or cooking , that you satisfy .
but if don the television , is possible that you who to short long-term , but not to long long-term .
&apos; so that , if your son is boring and you feed a ipad , is possible that already not . aburra , but not will learned to hands for yes same or to dosificarse &apos; , says the professor fenske .
and &apos; that capacity of dosificarse . applies to other situations &apos; , out .
your son not only learns to hands for yes only , but that learns to unchecked better in other areas .
not i that really want impressed the platitude .
but not should be too critical with he .
our aim should be , more well , the of be favourable paragraphs the rumour constant of the activities and the technologies .
the professor eastwood is of agreement .
&apos; to our way of see , need aburrirnos more , but the platitude is a i too distressing and disturbing as for linked with something that deserves the it &apos; , says .
out that what that the people really search is a way of switch and of enjoy of a time died .
&apos; in a environment in the that we constantly sobreestimulados &apos; , says , &apos; is difficult find forms of focus our attention when the noise by &apos; .
mistreated : , book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of marijuana
anthony orozco , student of 19 years in a institute community and footballer the south-east of fatherly , . faces to a process criminal for something that soon will legal in all the state : the possession of a stones of marijuana and a pipe that his for fumarla .
orozco says that a day of september , he and some friends conducían for lamar , in the plains urgently to the border of kansas , when the stopped the police .
the police found marijuana in the car and a time after orozco received a threatening legal for possession of drugs and articles related ( crimes under that threat every one a fined of 100 dollars americans ) in the that . you detectives of the date the trial .
&apos; we are as to criminal &apos; , says orozco .
? and what are ?
in the weeks of uncertainty following to the vote that had place in colorado for the legalisation of the possession of small quantities of marijuana for use hand , the answer in hundreds of causes under for possession of drugs on least of the law that of the location .
hundreds of crimes under for possession of marijuana . are overwritten therefore here as in the state of washington , where . adopted a measure similar .
the departments of police have longer of it charges against the elderly of 21 years for possession to small at , that . will legally a time the law has entered in force in the next weeks .
but the tax of districts more conservatives of mistreated . have committed to to forward with the cases open for possession of marijuana and still are quote to people .
the same time , several cities , since the suburbs of denver to the mountains western , are voting for prevent that . open shops of marijuana , you recently , in their communities .
&apos; all this is changing so quickly that not i what will what next &apos; , said daniel donnelly oates , head of police in aurora , fair the this of denver .
who . are of the regulations in the state of washington also are our around the issue .
and are for advice for establish a system of licences of production , manufacture , distribution and sale ; all this before of that it the date limit , the 1 of december of 2013 .
say that , for well or for wrong , colorado is for front of the majority of the states in as to the regulation the use of the marijuana , first with for terapeúticos and now for use hand .
&apos; mistreated at of a market more regulated , so that will a good guide &apos; , says brian shiga-toxin-producing smith , spokesman of the commission of control the alcohol the state of washington .
but the mr smith accepts that any place or system only can to suggestions on what that could work .
&apos; not there a real precedent that we as of model &apos; , says .
the law of washington , so-called i-502 , will in force the 6 of december , what that is also a year for the which . nadará between two waters , already that the system of licences in that state still not will , but the possession will legal .
also , some issues suffocation sensitive that must resolved for that period , as the way of keep a balance between the demand the state of offer a &apos; access appropriate &apos; to the marijuana authoritative and their ban of to business of cannabis in a radio than to 300 metres of schools , parks , areas of at children or centres children .
&apos; in no place will more difficult ubicar a business of cannabis authorised that in the areas urban , especially in the area cause of seattle &apos; , says ben livingston , spokesman the centre for the cannabis legal , a group of research created recently .
the 21 of november , oates , the head of police of aurora , sent a e-mail electronic to their players of police in the that them detectives of that the tax of the city nonetheless of prevail actions judicial for untruths very for possession of marijuana to people elderly of 21 years and of that the police commodities of it charges against these crimes &apos; with effect immediately &apos; .
the head of police oates said that them . away of to to the regulation of the city that regulates the as of marijuana with for therapeutic and that raise pursued to traffickers and sellers of drugs .
in the county of weld , in the north of fatherly , the tax the district , ken buck , represents a vision more strict .
after the vote , was that their office solitary pursued the cases of possession of marijuana , mainly for on to the consumers and that . have to receive treatment .
currently , amounted people . face to charges for possession of 56 grammes or least of marijuana , although many of them have other charges .
&apos; our office has the duty of prevail actions judicial against those untruths that in the at in that . being were crime &apos; , said the mr buck in a declaration .
the answer has been one even in places as the county rural of table , where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation of the marijuana .
the police of cardiff junction , the greater city the county , already not quotation to adults for possession of small quantities .
pete hautzinger , tax the district the county , supported this decision , but also decided not simply none of the cases outstanding for possession .
&apos; not i that is losing the time the to doing to the law to that this changes &apos; , said .
to despite of that the 55 for % of the voters supported the measure , never . was that to the consumption of marijuana for use hand the within the government and the system legal outside to be easy .
the reactions contradictory that arise for all the state are of clear a marked ambivalence between the officials regard the great experiment using in this state .
&apos; . is of a barrier cultural with the tax the district &apos; , says are mcAllister , a lawyer of denver that represents to the accused for possession of marijuana and that is spokesman local of the organisation national for the reform of the law on the marijuana .
&apos; have last therefore time moment to people to the courts that , in reality , still not can accept that be legal &apos; , said .
the be the first states that they the quantities small of marijuana of the same way that if outside alcohol , mistreated and washington . prepare for become in the cases of test to level national in as to the legalisation of drugs .
while lawyers and officials the state have with a new border of sales legal , also expect finns receive indications the government federal , that still for the consideration of the sale and the as of marijuana as crimes federal .
the defenders of the legalisation of the marijuana have the hope of that the department of justice by .
to despite of that . have there some leading arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for for therapeutic , the government federal has allowed in their majority that there business of sale of marijuana with these for in fatherly , washington and 16 states more .
&apos; although is likely that the players integrates not tiren doors from for from a exchange of drugs small , probably . will averse to allow the functioning of shops regulated for the state for the sale of marijuana for use hand , one in the new law &apos; , said kevin by sabet , a exasesor of policy integrates of the administration of obama .
several cities of fatherly not expect to that act the authorities federal .
even before the day of the elections , some governments local number moratoriums on any shop new of marijuana , to despite of that will around of a year before of that who of them can open .
the week last , the city western of montrose adopted a ban of six months and is likely that the support the week that next .
&apos; not we put in a situation in the that admittedly to someone and then we a serious problem to level federal &apos; , he wishing nicholson , member the city .
&apos; our community voted in against of this amendment .
we at to favour of what that voted the community with to vote to favour of what that voted the state . &apos;
arise many questions the regard .
petronella wyatt : &apos; i acosaron to down of oxford for be a hunted &apos;
not . strikes to the it for their points of view only now
not i no at in my life in the that not has state boggles in to a square in the university of oxford .
therefore my father as my brother greater had state in the that i supposed was the better place the world for learn , a symposium greek of the was contemporary that well-balanced the two pillars of the civilisation : the thinking free and the tolerance .
, however , to the two weeks of should my square in the worcester remarkable to end of the years 80 for welcome the career of history , already had fact the bags , what that triggered the first scandal of my life .
my father . outset and . retraced to our .
my friends were there .
the newspaper the evening standard said that i had abandoned because not toleraba that some colleagues of university maintained relations sexual in the room of the on .
the he by n. wilson announced jest that i had gone because i thrown to drinking in tazas desconchadas .
the truth was least funny .
huí of there .
yes , huí , because had state put to a systematic harassment and intimidation .
not because to my extravagante name , not the fact of that from of a school private .
i acosaron for a only reason , that in the cradle of the so-called illustration was something to and barbaric : my father , the loss woodrow wyatt , was a &apos; advisory of margaret thatcher and i install the party conservative .
perhaps . ask to what next that now .
well , several reports show that a new generation of students of centre right is suffering a persecution similar .
the hatred repentance and growing towards the students the party conservative is such in oxford that , the week last , a group of them called the same level of equal of rights that have the homosexual , the disabled and the minorities ethnic .
member conservatives of the jCR ( grouping of students of degree ) the corpus christi college claim that are &apos; to often seriously paragraphs , personally attacked and treaties as people not objected &apos; for their ideas policies .
want create a since in the committee of equal of opportunities of their school university for ensure of power express their views freely .
their situation not . was merely for a recent documentary of the bBC2 called &apos; wonderland : highlights , bright and as the right &apos; ( the paradise : young , it and of right ) on the policy of the students and that presented to the tories as excéntricos and neo-nazism .
mostraba the student of master joe cooke , expresidente of the partnership the party conservative of the university of oxford ( oUCA ) , in a brand-new , baseball a suit carefully and a stick with the empuñadura of silver .
in other universities , the students conservatives say that . them is as &apos; them of turkish &apos; for the introduction of rates of plate more higher .
luke black , of 20 years and vice-president of the partnership the party conservative of the university of damage , declared in a newspaper transcript that &apos; there a growing trend of left in the universities .
the people moderating that we as the bullingdon club , not so even conocernos &apos; .
samuel bernard , of 21 years and student of history in corpus christi that presented the motion for a greater protection , says that this environment is &apos; you &apos; , while that stephanie cherill , of 19 years and president elected of the oUCA , says that the attitude of the member of the jCR towards the people that are of centre right has worsened .
&apos; this is a threat for the environment of debate intellectual , so as for the welfare of the member &apos; , says .
for my first weeks in oxford i more single that the a .
there in the university in september of 1986 , was a young of 18 years painfully timid .
the hatred towards the party conservative was in their point more high .
the year previous , the university had voted can to margaret thatcher , former alumna , a title &apos; szczeciń cause &apos; after the cuts in the funding of the education higher .
the environment would fact horrifying of appalling to any stalinist .
already for the first days of the week of welcome to the new it , when the new students . know and know to the professors , received a shows of the bitterness that i than .
thoroughly that the professors not only the the view blind to the mofa that . was of the it conservatives , but that involved in she of good earns .
the policy of the strike of the miners , the privatisation and the opposition the government to the sanctions against the apartheid in south came to the rooms of wood the seminar .
the first that i . be speak the english texts french the century 18th and i not was ready for what that wine to continuation .
&apos; señorita wyatt &apos; , said the professor harry pitt ( already died ) , &apos; for favour , translates the first paragraph &apos; .
not realised not a .
pitt , a man bajito with a face that seemed mass of bizcocho , was well how who bad bilis .
&apos; ? is that the thatcheristas . refuse to learn french or is that , simply , are thinks ? &apos; , asked .
the other it . laughed .
i brought the eyes of the tears that was of contain .
&apos; you suggest that will to classes of french in their time free , always and when not is too occupied as people &apos; , gruñó pitt .
returned to my room as a soul in it .
that night i sat single to the time of the dinner in the university ; then felt a there pat in the on .
was a student of english of second year called james that . presented as member of the oUCA .
&apos; i who you &apos; , i said politely .
&apos; i fear that so is as is the thing .
. mouths with who that be suspect of be hunted .
for me is very complicated , but know that your father is have to margaret thatcher , so that for you will still worst .
many tories would newcomers aparentar be labour &apos; .
more forward , in a lunches local , i cowardly hide .
stressed in that not was of agreement with all what that said the mrs thatcher .
that trick s pointless .
a student of first year of philosophy , policies and economy that , paradoxically , had examined in eton , said : &apos; you daughter of a pig fascist .
you would &apos; .
other students they that cancioncilla .
i became in the amount pervertida .
&apos; ? how have relations sexual the tories ? &apos; , asked one .
&apos; . are a him the one the another , ? not ? &apos;
i felt of the same way that should have sense the homosexual before of the law liberal of the years 60 .
? could some day to a life normal in oxford ?
? i be forced to be with people that advise as i only after the anochecer ?
? would that plenty labour and suppressed my trends natural ?
the three years that i were . were as a purgatory of assumption and isolation .
the only professor openly hunted was norman smug , professor of history contemporary aimed to my school university .
you odiaban for be not only the party conservative , but also advisory of thatcher in policy foreign and a of the people that you go their speeches .
hardly was for there .
detestaba the place for that what he parochial and it and for their wet to the vision marxista-determinista of the history .
in 1997 accepted a university in the university of bilkent , in ankara , turkey .
&apos; here not you to be happy &apos; , i said .
i to visit daily of oxford to home of my parents in london , finding refuge in my family and friends of mentality cause more open .
you i to my father that hated oxford and for what .
not i believed .
when he long there in the years 40 , . deleting all the points of view political .
&apos; but if is the better place the world &apos; , said with sadness .
&apos; them never would that , not there between my dear overtime of dream .
to my friends communist always had a attitude whiter &apos; .
their doloridos eyes they to nublarse .
&apos; dale other opportunity .
i sure of that what have fact only for bromear .
. i tipperary the heart if what dejaras . &apos;
structural of many travel to london , my resistance emotional . was deteriorating .
a friend mine , that also install the party conservative , had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced to their cultures .
the week next , for a seminar in the that another professor of history had hinted , about completely in seriously , that i was a &apos; enemy the people &apos; , decided to what same .
red of shame for within , admití that my parents i had &apos; laundering the which &apos; and them notified &apos; old broke &apos; .
the truce for little time .
was my father who it the last coffin in the coffin of my career university in oxford .
for at then my father illiterate two columnas week in the press of murdoch .
my door was closed with key .
i was within acurrucada of fear and , automatic five minutes , my persecutors desistieron .
when . were i the sprinkler and took the first train to london .
never returned .
perhaps i llaméis weak llorona .
but no person of 18 years should be put to such level of intimidation and hostility in a institution analyses .
what that is still more tragic is that was oxford , that not only has have to 14 first ministers the party conservative but that , to day of today , . behind after a ensure nothing delight of equal and freedom of thinking .

a package the government for marriages and parents make to 15 dollars for child , or the licences for leave and spread profits tax .
but all this has had little effect .
singapore is a city state rich and of high technology in the south-east of asia , also known for the conservatism of their leaders and their needed controls social .
the rate of birth of singapore , of agreement with their division national of population , . is currently in 1.2 children for woman .
the last time that was for above of 2 -conocida as rate of reposición- was in 1976 .
so that ? for what the singapurenses not have more children ?
so wei ming , director of policies of marriage and family of the division national of population , says that is because to a &apos; better education &apos; and &apos; a range more wider of opportunities of career &apos; .
&apos; that you has allowed to the people have of a range more wider of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities , more beyond of marriage and be a family &apos; , explains .
these changes in the rules social have contributed the increase of the soltería , and to delay the marriage and the certificate , what that it as result a in of the rate of birth in singapore .
while therefore , a policy of immigration ue is to increase drastically the immigration for to with to the in of the population has created umbrage between the population local .
in singapore there websites website where rife the xenophobia hardly provision against many new immigrants , in particular the chinese , to the that critics for keep the wages netherlands and not integrated .
the increase of the immigration also is seen as a of the reasons for the that the year last the party of government of singapore experienced their worst result electoral since the independence .
since the elections has there a attempt of correct the problem , with the quotas and taxes more higher for the workers foreign .
consequences unexpected
while that the fall in the rate of birth has effects known in the growth economic of a nation , the income tax , the costs health and the policies of immigration , the example of singapore also is taking some consequences unexpected .
the government is that not . built many houses small .
for example , has started to affect the sector estate .
the authority of development urban has last to control the number of over small , known as &apos; box of shoes &apos; , that . they build in certain areas of the city .
these over have land of 46 metres square and have had a success of sales .
, however , there concern of that they promote a lifestyle of life of soltería and desanimen to the developers that want build houses large , family .
but lim &quot; soon , director general of the company buildings el developers , says that their &apos; boxes of shoes &apos; . sold a more quickly that the units more large .
are more popular , in the sense of that the units . exhausted days , even weeks , more quickly that the units of greater size .
this ago that be a better for our flow of box .
, however , accepts that the new rules are guidelines more clear for the developers , to the that before . them were snags if wanted offer too units small in a project .
too estresados
singapore is a city state .
if well these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the rate of birth national , the about with the singapurenses that working in the district financial the centre prompt that not will to have a effect .
&apos; the people is very version , the houses are sides and also what is the education , for what that many people what are they &apos; , says a young executive .
other people can have children .
&apos; but for me is important have with my own money and time &apos; , says another young of a 20 years .
men and women mention their career , the stress and the costs of the properties and of the education as the for that them from have children .
so that , for a that the government involved of if to their citizens to have children , when . is of to babies , the singapurenses are who have the last word .

&apos; suramérica must learn of europe for integrate a citizenship &apos; : raphael correa
the president of ecuador , raphael correa , said today that the creation of a citizenship common is a goal in the that &apos; suramérica , in this case yes , must learn of europe &apos; .
correa , that part in the sixth summit presidential of the union of nations suramericanas ( unasur ) , held in lima , declared to the state broadcasters peru that the european &apos; . were in the second war world &apos; and in other conflicts , &apos; but now are virtually a homeland &apos; .
for , in that sense , the project of establish the citizenship suramericana that encouraged the countries member of the unasur .
&apos; there that to the free mobility of citizens and workers for any country suramericano , as already happens with the those of the community andean , but still there sectors reaccionarios that we want restore the last &apos; , warned .
the president brutally . was , also , to favour of the up of the organisation of states american ( operator ) under the premise of down the influence of the states continental and have in account to the that have signed the pact of st josé on the rights human .
the that are university never . themselves to nothing and , in change , us the suramericanos what arrangement all .
&apos; is incomprehensible that the commission which of rights human is in washington under the funding of states united &apos; , said in referring the asylum political given for ecuador the founder of wikileaks , julian assange .
joão was that not is arrepentido of that decision because with this not has betrayed their principles , but that has respected their &apos; profound values democratic and of rights human &apos; .
manner that , in their at , &apos; had olaf cruel of that assange outside extradited to a third country and not . it their process &apos; .
listening , also , to the justice swedish for geographically that . able in their territory the interrogation for a alleged crime sexual when &apos; the own legislation swedish allows obviously by video , that . could to since the embassy of ecuador in london &apos; .
joão said that there the risk of that . deteriorate the health physical and mental of assange .
&apos; not i about with he since that is in our embassy , but the her i informed that had a small problem allegedly , nothing serious &apos; , said the event brutally .
what that yes there is the danger of that . deteriorate their health physical and mental for be he in a space small , power to occasional the air free .
&apos; that complicates the health of any person &apos; , manner .
joão pointed that the solution the asylum orientates to assange since june in the embassy ecuatoriana in london , by the granting of a salvaconducto that you to travel to ecuador , is in hands of great britain , sweden and the authorities legal european and it that has there discussions with london in search of a solution the encierro the founder of wikileaks .
us not negotiate with rights human , that word not the we in this case , but has there permanent discussions .
&apos; the solution of this problem is in hands of great britain , sweden and of the authorities legal european because the lawyer of assange , baltazar garzón , is doing a series of procedures in different bodies european &apos; , mentioned .
and opinion that &apos; if great britain it morning the convince this . has &apos; .
and if sweden , as perfectly what allows their legislation and as has fact in other cases , interroga the mr assange in the embassy of ecuador in london or what interroga to skype morning same . has this problem .
correa availed for failure as a ombudsman of the freedom of press and matizó that what that not does is &apos; the mediocrity , the bad faith and the lie , that weaken the freedom of expression &apos; .
&apos; the elderly enemies of the freedom of press not we the political villains and grievously but the one journalists in role the profit , the blackmail and the extortion &apos; , said .
in that aspect . welcomed that already not are these journalists &apos; not the bankers not the countries hegemonic and middle the that dominated to ecuador &apos; , and forward that of be his &apos; profundizará in the revolution for continue the way and the direction right &apos; .
joão also supported the decision of keep the veto to paraguay in the unasur the least to their next elections , the argue that the body &apos; must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the golpismo fraught of legality &apos; because in reality &apos; shall the legitimacy of the democracy paraguaya &apos; .
the president brutally was , also , &apos; perfectly relevant &apos; the i of their counterpart response , juan manuel holy , of negotiate now with nicaragua the limits seaports between both countries after the failure of the court international of justice of the has , that influences to the sovereignty maritime nicaragüense .
for the at not . by that failure .
is a problem between a country anything and one centroamericano .
the conflicts are inevitable , but must be overcome for the will of moving together .
there that them of way wider for resolved and to forward .
also well-balanced in a good conclusion the dispute for limits seaports that have in the same court peru and chile and opinion that &apos; is right for america latin to bodies international if the two countries . themselves to accept failure for hard that be &apos; .
in reference to the possibility that . present as candidate in the next elections presidential in ecuador for to a third mandate running pointed that is that possibility &apos; with a optimism and joy , although to sometimes is quite hard &apos; .
correa was that if lose the at of february the 2013 . will of the life public .
in what personal never i has interested the power , but in situations so upon as the of ecuador that poverty socio-economic only . can correct since the power political .
&apos; my movement pólitico believed that was i who stood that likely victory , therefore we that accept that reponsabilidad &apos; , said .
of win would my last period in the presidency and of there are of the life public .
if we as .
&apos; is a decision &apos; , said .
joão . referred also the new treatment of health the president which hugo chávez in cuba .
just of about with the vice-president which claus maduro and i says that was to a treatment that already was planned , of routine , that . expectation that pass the campaign for again to cuba .
&apos; not means a he in the state of health the president chávez &apos; , a .
the head of state brutally part today in lima in the sixth summit of heads of state and government of the union of nations suramericanas ( unasur ) that brought with called to a greater integration regional for holding the progress , the equal and the security .
deaths for aids today are cause of detection mention
fabrizio had 21 years of age when you anticipated the result of the test : aids positive .
&apos; was as if i out a bomb &apos; , as the useful the at the announcement , that the doctor he to &apos; more suavecito &apos; , , success clear .
the child what secret to their family .
decided done office only of their disease and started to needs on she ; with such as that already festejó their birthday 43 .
is , , doubt , one of the patients more old of the unit of hiv the hospital civil of long-standing ( hCG ) , to the that came in 1994 after of several battles .
fabrizio lives with the virus of the line human ( hiv ) since ago 22 years , something difficult of imagine to principles of the 90 , when had many doubt , few options of treatment and more stigma .
then , to the director of a clinic the iMSS blackout despedirse of he &apos; because traía a off &apos; .
then , have aids was synonymous of death .
now is possible survive to this syndrome and do with quality of life .
, however , uninformed of their disease , still many people they when the virus already has caused havoc , &apos; reached &apos; their system immune and are victims of infections opportunistic .
to 31 years of the emergence the aids in the world , the least of the first cases reported , &apos; the great achievement means in this at that the sobrevida of a patient that as treatment in way have and the sobrevida of the population general , is exactly as &apos; , pressed the head of the unit of hiv the hCG , jaime andrade villanueva , after referring that this information was supported in april of this year in a publication scientific prestigiada .
infectólogo and expert in hiv / aids , andrade villanueva a that since the year 2008 , the scientists had concluded that the aids not was a ruling fatal , but the years of survival and the quality of life on the degree of afectación the system immune that have the patients the an the diagnosis , with better expectation for who not are users of drugs : of to 30 years with a conteo of 200 cD4 and of 50 years , when our 500 cD4 .
in words simple , what previous means that who a the diagnosis of hiv positive to the 25 years of age , under these terms &apos; while . keep in control will live , problems to the 75 years &apos; , he the ashraf .
for dimensionar this progress , is remember that the hope of life of the mexican today is of 76 years in average .
if well the mortality has down significantly in the last years , in the case of mexico , the number of people that die of aids struggle of 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 ( reporte annual of unaids ) , also is true that since the emergence the aids , 60 for % of the patients in the basis of data national have died .
only in jalisco as people died in 2011 , and will 187 deaths to may of this year ; not however . will that there access universal to the drugs anti-retroviral since 2005 .
- ? for what still they deaths ?
- to me i seems that the problem not is of access to treatment .
so what visualizo , so we has happened in our hospital .
the least in the last 12 years not we had desabasto of medicine the problem is that the patients they very advanced because not their state of infection , or be , in stages late of the disease .
was a fact no : &apos; nine of every ten patients they when already have any infection offence what that . has that to for have a greater impact on the mortality global , is to verdicts more tempranos and , for what therefore , . have that offer evidence of detection of way mass , to all the people that what overnight &apos; .
in their proposal line specialists and officials the council state of prevention the aids in jalisco ( coesida ) , also the own patients , as fabrizio , who turned to done the test to a laboratory particular , only drove because what had fact a friend and , despite to their shorter age , already was in stage of aids and even padeció sarcoma of kaposi , a by resembles that is a of the complications common .
all time when know that you aids .
some think that . will to die and not want know nothing .
&apos; if already i i to die , better i reviento three sometimes to the week &apos; , say not in my case .
the change was for improve , i food well , i exercise , i the medicines .
to the date , their parents only know that padeció cancer .
live a life normal , as who .
&apos; work , i many activities , i , i a life sexual active , but shares , i cuido to me and to the other person &apos; , enumeró fabrizio , who accepted share their privacy with mILENIO jALISCO for motivating with their that to who today , in the framework the day world the aids , have fear .
that . do the test , if had risk , that between more soon know if are hiv positive , is better and if already have the diagnosis , that learn that can live as any person , being responsible .
that , their message , sums the motto of battle the aids this 2012 .

and that was the principle of mincy , one of the best players that has had port puerto .
bartow then recommended the francotirador raymond gausse , that was nativizado and was one of our best competitions .
i that said that if mincy you had given a championship to bayamon , gausse help to bring another more .
