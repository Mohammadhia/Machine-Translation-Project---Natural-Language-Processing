The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of Southerners led Colbert to train himself to suppress his Southern accent while he was still quite young .
As a child , he observed that Southerners were often depicted as being less intelligent than other characters on scripted television ; to avoid that stereotype , he taught himself to imitate the speech of American news anchors .
While Colbert sometimes comedically claims his surname is French , he is of 15/16ths Irish ancestry ( one of his paternal great-great-grandmothers was of German and English descent ) .
Michael is the central character of the series , serving as Regional Manager of the Scranton branch of paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin Inc.
